connecting to databases
    - connecting the ide to mysql
        can query db from ide
    - connect via payara server
        allows application to use java persistence api which rely on payara connection pools
    - add a dependency via maven
        allows reverse engineering of databases

use the intranet database (make sure uname and stuff is set up)

payara admin console - localhost:4848

jpa overview
    bridges the gap between relational mapping and oop - object-relational mapping (orm)
    used to persist data n relational form
    generally 1:1 mapping isn't an issue

    jpa annotations used for objects in database
    have to have a totally empty constructor as well as any used ones
        used in circumstnaces like when the database itself generates a primary key
        the object would need to be instantiated, empty, then a key generated, then filled

    1:N mapping is where is gets tricky
        [[todo]]

    classes or tables first?
        will generally have to deal with both solutions
