java server faces
    a mvc framework
    focused around connecting ui components/widgets with data sources and server-side event handlers
    renders the components automatically for the reuired client type

    syntax
        that weird <c:url> shit butit's <h:outputText> this time
        also we get values similarly to ${} in jsps, but it's #{}

    any class can function as a bean
        - needs to be annotated 
            @Named(value = "whatever")
            @RequestScoped
                // this one can also be application- or session-scoped
        
    can map stuff like forms to fields or methods of a bean class

    if the output is null the whole html item won't be shown
