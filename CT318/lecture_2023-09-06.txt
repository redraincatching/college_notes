human-computer interaction
    "a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use, and the study of major phenomena surrounding them"
        - acm sigchi, 1992

    what is hci?
        "lots of things now i guess"
            - john m carroll
        social use and aiming to design for universal, not individual access
        
    evolution of hci
        in the 70s/80s computing moved from being a specialist tool, like heavy machinery, to being a personal computer
            needed to, therefore, move away from cli which needed specialist training to use, and towards gui and general audiences
            spreadsheets were the first apps that prompted these changes

        first computer?
            depending on the definition, the abacus, sundial, anything that allowed you to offload computation
        first mechanical computer?
            charles babbage's difference engine
        first electronic?
            first world war, ada lovelace
                -> really interesting topic, the social changes as computing moved more mainstream and away from being a "woman's job" as it became clear money could be made from it
        now personal computers, mobile devices, embedded devices, wearable computers

    initial hci evolved to consider 
        - overall ux
        - flow (how users make use of and move through an interface)
        - fun/user enjoyment
        - well-being
            > obviously negative aspects investigated here, as companies exploited the human psyche to enable addiction
        
    does it matter?
        "interaction designers can make an effort to keep simple tasks easy for the user, and to make complex tasks possible"
            - alan kay
        what is the human doing?
            - interacting, how?
            - manipulating
            - selecting
            - memory
            - creating
        what is the computer doing?
            - computing
            - information storage/retrieval
            - data analysis & visualisation
