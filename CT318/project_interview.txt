interview with an elite athlete

-  what's it like being so incredibly pretty and sexy?

i'm glad you asked, no one talks about this aspect of sport enough. it's a real burden, but it takes the strongest of us to bear it. i have struggled with this curse a long time, and i have now become accustomed to its weight.

- how do you ensure effective communication with your coach, particularly when it comes to expressing your needs, concerns, or areas where you feel you need additional support?

i mean, the ideal would be to just chat to your coach immediately after a session, but not every coach is a full-time coach, so they may have to race off and you won't get a chance to talk to them, or there might be other people who want to talk to them, or any other number of reasons. hell, straight after a training session isn't exactly the best time to be handling anything important, we all know your brain isn't functioning at 100% then. after that, texting is probably the best, since i'm an adult i can do tha but younger athletes will have to go through whatever official app we use, and honestly that's sort of terrible for messaging, if i'm being honest

- how do you facilitate communication and understanding among teammates and coaches to ensure everyone is on the same page?

that's probably one of the biggest challenges, we have like eight different platforms we all use to communicate, and no one is on all of them. i refuse to use our snapchat groupchats, i just get my little brother tell me if anything important happens

- how do you approach visualizing your progress in your sport, especially during challenging times?

well, it's hard to actually see how far you've come, because you're constantly comparing yourself to your goals, no matter how far you've come, so you lose track of that. i myself use swimcloud, a website designed for tracking college athletes in the US, which builds profiles for swimmers all around the world who've competed in competitions of a certain standard. it's really useful to see your actual progression over time, and it stops you from spiralling in the worst of circumstances, you know?

- what methods do you use to track your athletic progress, both quantitatively and qualitatively?

like i said, swimcloud is great, but it doesn't track every competition, and i can't really enter things manually, it's all ripped from the hytek times that officials upload. to fill in those gaps, i just use a spreadsheet, plain and simple

- how do you handle situations where your performance metrics may not align with your initial goals, and how do you adjust your approach accordingly?

it's not worth doing straight after a race, i'll say that much. you need to take a while to let your head cool, and then check your form, your technique, how everything was going prior to the competition. there are too many variables to attribute a bad performance, or one that isn't as good as you hoped, to just your own efforts, your condition is affected by more than that.

- can you discuss the role of data and analytics in tracking your progress, and how it influences your training approach?

i usually keep a training diary, of how i was feeling, how i was performing during a particular session, which is pretty handy, helps me look at the season itself continuously, rather than in snapshots like you'd get from competition data. it's a lot of work to maintain, but in my opiinion it's worth it. i know some people track this digitally, but honestly i stick to pen and paper for it, a literal training journal.

- how do you manage your time effectively to balance training, competition, recovery, and other commitments?

barely. no, it's incredibly hard to balance being a full-time athlete with being in college all the time and trying to rest. trying to fit in a social life is even a stretch, realistically to be a top-tier athlete you have to throw out everything else, or at least put it to the side, so scheduling every other aspect of your life pretty much to the minute is vital

- have there been instances where scheduling conflicts or time constraints posed challenges to your training, and how did you navigate through them?

oh, so many. i don't go out or drink in the week or so leading up to a gala, so any social events later than about 8pm are completely out. if i want to meet people i'll have to make time during the day. on top of that, i've had to drop out of national races - ones i would've been in the running to win - in order to sit exams, and i know i'm not the only college student facing that problem. all in all, no matter how well you organise your timetable, you have to move things around
