design process
    how to design?
        - first: what are we designing?
        - then: how do we design it?
            - what steps are involved?
            - what tools and techniques?

    ux design
        - don norman, apple's first ux architect in the 90s
            "ux encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products"
        ux - how a product behaves and is used by people when they interact with it
        cannot design a user experience, can only design for an experience

        design exercise - an alarm clock
            - why?
                wake you up
            - what?
                - ease of use
                - on/off/snooze
            - how?
                - gentle / annoying?
                - mood / sleep cycle?

        ux starts from the why - the needs and emotions involved in the actions
            the _appropriate_ way to combine intent and action

interaction model
    norman
        - 1988
        - stages of action in an interactive product
        - interactive cycle
            - user formulates a plan of action (intention)
            - executes this at interface (action)
            - when executed the user observes the interface for the result to determine future actions (evaluation)

            good user design - their intention will be easy to achieve and basically the same as intended

            action and evaluation are broken down into seven stages
                - establishing a goal
                - forming the intention
                - specifying the action sequence
                - executing the action
                - perceiving the system state
                - interpreting the system state
                - evaluating the state wrt goals and intentions
            
            e.g.
                - what do i want to do? 
                    - find the customer support email
                - i click on "contact us"
                - i look for that link
                - i click that link
                - page updates
                - i read and there is no email
                - this means i have to make a new action to find the email
                    -> cycle repeats

    execution
        user and system use different languages - translation is our job as designers
        if system actions correspond to user actions, the interaction is effective
        gulf of execution:
            difference between user's formulation of actions to reach the goal & actions allowed by system
            -> interfaces should be designed to reduce this gulf

    evaluation
        similar concept with the gulf of evaluation:
            distance between physical system state and user expectation
        should be obvious that an action has taken place, whether executed successfully or failed

    visibility vs expectation
        e.g. does a button show the state that the system is in, or the state that is will be in once pressed?; windows setting toggle switch vs video player play/pause button

    design in terms of interaction model
        create visual and functional similarities to familiar designs
