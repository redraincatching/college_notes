        first part of design is to establish and fully define the problem, in order to figure out which solution is the best

    interaction design process
        - a goal-directed problem solving activity informed by intended use, target domain, materials, and cost

        4 basic activities
            - identifying needs and establishing requirements
            - developing alternative design
            - building interactive versions of the design
            - evaluating design

    design thinking
        - iterative, nonlinear design process
        - well-suited to ill-defined, unknown process
