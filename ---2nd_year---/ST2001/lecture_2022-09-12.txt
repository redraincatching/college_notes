summarising continuous data
    numerical data properties
        - central tendency
            mean, median, mode

            numerical summary of typical value
                [[diagram]]
                // note: another notation for sample median is q_2

        - variation
            range, variance, iqr, standard deviation

            numerical summary of spread
                range = max - min
                    -> badly affected by outliers
                iqr - tukey method
                    q_0 is min
                    q_1 is median of bottom 50%
                    q_2 is median
                    q_3 is median of top 50%
                    q_4 is max

                    iqr is q_3 - q_1
                        -> above and below the median if n is even
                        -> include median in both if odd

                [[diagram]]
                    - common measure of spread is the standard deviation
                        -> distance of each datapoint from the mean
                    - since the sum of all deviations is zero, we square them and find an average (sorta) of them, called the variance
                    - we then root the average squared deviation

                    //note: since we use the sample mean, we have to subtract one from n
                    // the standard deviation is senstitive to outliers, and is in the sampel unit as the population

        - shape
            outliers, symmetry vs. skewness
