what are statistics?
    numerical information computed from data
    science of statistics
        collecting, classifying, analysing, estimating, and interpreting data

    role of statistics
        collection, analysis, and presentation of data to
            - make decisions
            - solve problems
            - design products and processes
        the science of uncertainty

    role of probability
        provides the framework for the study and application of statistics

descriptive statistics
    science of summarising data, numerically and graphically

    analysis methods applicable depend on the variable being measured and the research questions you are trying to answer

inferential statistics
    using information from a sample to say something about the population of interest

terminology
    experimental unit
        a single object upon which we collect data
    population
        a collection of experimental units that we are interested in studying
    sample
        subset of the population
    variable
        characteristic or property of an individual experimental unit
        types of variable
            - qualitative
            - quantitative

            qualitative
                classified into categories
                can be ordered
                    e.g. grade achieved in a class
                or unordered
                    e.g. gender or employee, method of payment

            quantitative
                can be divided into discrete or quantitative
                    discrete
                        isolated values
                    continuous
                        any value over a range or multiple ranges

questions to ask
    - what is the typical observation?
    - is there much variation/spread between individuals in the dataset?
    - what is the shape of this distribution?
    - are there any outliers?

    summarising can be done numerically or graphically
        graphically: bar/pie charts
            // don't use pie charts, human brains are shit
