    installation
        4 main ways
            - import as a content delivery network (cdn) package on the page
            - download the js files and host them yourself
            - install using npm
            - use the official cli to scaffold a project

        - pinia
        - vue router
        - vue dev tools

    the src folder is where the vue building tends to take place
    in index.html, there's basically one div called "app", and vue injects all of the necessary code into there

    single file components
        any file with a .vue extension
        the idea is that you build reusable components and toss them in wherever necessary
        the router also decides what goes where based on the url, rather than changing webpages

        three parts to a component
            - js script setup
            - html template
                any content in a template tag is hidden by default, and can be then requested by js at a later time
                this allows the site to send everything to the user, and then render at the end
            - css (scoped)

        components need to be precompiled by a vue compiler, the browser won't be able to parse them
            // done with npm run dev or npm run build

        you can pass data between components using props

    app.vue
        the entry point, or root level component
        used to import other components into your application

        in the script tag we import the components
        and then in the template we use them like html tags
