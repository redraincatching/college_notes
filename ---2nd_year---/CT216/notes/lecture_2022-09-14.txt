cloud computing
    a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources, that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction

    started with selling storage
        simple storage service  - amazon, 2006
            -> this allowed users to store documents and data without having to purchase and manage the underlying server hardware themselves

    then came computing
        amazon's elastic compute cloud, or ec2

    types of cloud computing
        public cloud
            - any member of the public can sign up and start provisioning computing resources
            - highly scalable
        private cloud
            - computing resources allocated to a single user
        hybrid
            - cloud computing servers with public and private sections

    software as a service
        provides users with - essentially - a cloud service, the platform on which it runs, and the underlying infrastructure
    platform as a service
        provides users with a platform on which to run software, and the necessary it infrastructure to run it
    infrastructure as a service
        provides users with computing, networking, and storage resources

        virtual servers (iaas)
            used to create highly customisable virtual machines and instance

    advantages of cloud computing
        - elasticity
        - economy of scale
    disadvantages
        - security
        - cost
        - migration issues
