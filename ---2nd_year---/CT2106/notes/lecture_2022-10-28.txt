interfaces
    similar to a class
    can be used as a type
    names often end in -able by convention

    more like an outline of what methods a class should have

    interface example
        public interface Eatable {

            public int getCalories();

            public int extractEnergy();
        }

    // fields can be input in the latest version of java, they are treated as public static final
    // we won't worry about that for now

    comparable interface
        built in compareTo() method
            compares two objects

    any class that wants to implement an interface needs to use the keyword implements in the class declaration
    example
        public class Bombay extends Cat implements Predator {
            //...
        }
