2d games programming in java
    jframes - 2d coordinate system
        the jframe class provides a window with an associated graphic canvas, along with a pixel-based coordinate system
        origin (0,0) is at the top left, but this is actually hidden under the title bar

    basic graphics in java
        2d graphics can be drawn using the Graphics class
        provides methods fofr drawing "primitives" (lines, circles, boxes) and images (.png, etc)
        the paint() method of the JFrame class is automatically invoked whenever it needs to be painted (system-invoked)
            // or you can force it to happen using repaint(), for when you wish to paint but the os doesn't think it's needed

        paint signature
            public void paint (Graphics g);
