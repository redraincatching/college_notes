transposition/permutation ciphers
    hide the message by rearranging the letters without altering the letters used
    - rail fence cipher
    - row transposition cipher

product ciphers
    a substitution cipher followed by a transposition cipher
        -> principle that composing ciphers creates a stronger cipher

steganography
    an alternative to encryption
    rather than hiding the contents of the message, hiding the existence of a message
    drawback: not very economical in terms of overheads

    image steganography
        assume an x by y pixel image stored in rgb format
        each pixel intensity represented by a byte for each colour component
            -> the image can be stored in a byte array of size [x][y][3]
        [[diagram]]
        for each entry we change the least significant bit to hide a bitwise message
        // note: compression interferes with this



human security
    "if you design something idiot-proof, the universe will design a better idiot"

    password
        a memorised secret used to confirm the identity of the user
            a purely numeric secret is a personal identification number
        the secret is memorised by a party called the claimant, while the verifying party is the verifier
            they communicate using an authentication protocol

        alternatives to passwords
            - one-time passwords, possibly time-sensitive (otps)
            - biometric methods
            - cognitive passwords (question and answer)

            online banking uses a list of transaction authentication numbers (tans), which can only be used once

        algorithmic generation of otps
            paper-based tans are hard to manage, as are black and tans
            otps can be gernerated from past otps used
                an example credited to leslie lamport uses a one-way (hash) function

            one-way functions
                a one-way function H produces a fixed-size output h based on a variable input size s
                    H(s) = h
                    H is a hash function, h is the hash
                for a given hash code h it is infeasible to find s such that H(s) = h

            lamport's algorithm
                for every claimant a random seed s is chosen
                a hash function is repeatedly applied, n times, to the seed, giving a value of H^n(s), which is stored by the verifier
                the claimant keeps the seed s

                the user's first login uses an otp derived by applying H n-1 times, or H^(n-1)(s)
                the verifier can authenticate this as H(p) = H^n(s)
                the value stored is replaced by p
                
                the next lgoin is accompanied by the otp H^(n-2)(s), and this is verified as H(p_2) = p

                // this continues as necessary

            time synchronised otp
                each user has a specific piece of hardware called a security token which generates an otp
                inside the token is a clock, synchronised with the verifier
                both the claimant token and verifier calculate identical otps using the time as a seed
                [[diagram]]
                [[diagram]]
                // these are really difficult to build and synchronise
                // fuck physics, man

        biometric methods
            - hand geometry
                measurement and comparison of the (unique) different physical characteristics of the hand
            - palm vein authentication
                uses an infrared beam to penetrate the users hand as it is waved over the system;the veins within the palm of the user are returned as black lines
            - retina scan
                provides an analysis of the capillary blood vessels located in the back of the eye
            - iris scan
                provides an analysis of the rings, furrows and freckles in the colored ring that surrounds the pupil of the eye
            - face recognition, signature and voice analysis

        multi-factor authentication
            usually some combination of the following
                - physical object
                - secret
                - physical characteristic
                - geolocation

            2013, a google study concluded most people's passwords are generated from readily available information
                1) pet names
                2) a notable date, such as a wedding anniversary
                3) a family member’s birthday
                4) your child’s name
                5) another family member’s name
                6) your birthplace
                7) a favourite holiday
                8) something related to your favourite sports team
                9) the name of a significant other
