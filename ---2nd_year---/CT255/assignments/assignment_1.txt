    the general data protection regulation (gdpr) is the section of EU regulation that governs the handling and transfer of personal data, and all relevant privacy protections. 
    the gdpr applies to all individuals in the european economic area, and has special provisions pertaining to the tansfer of data to areas not protected by gdpr, such as to the united states.
    the aim of gdpr is to increase the control individuals have other any and all personal data that they own, as the european union considers this a fundamental human right, as outlined in the charter of fundamental rights in the european union.

ii)
    the proposal for the gdpr was released on the 25th of january, 2012, and was adopted on the 8th of april, 2016. the stated aim of the introduction of the gdpr was to simplify regulations regarding data handling, processing, and transfer for international businesses, as well as to provide greater protections and rights to individuals. 
    the discussions regarding what would later become the gdpr began in 2012, as the european commission felt that the 1995 data protection rules needed a comprehensive reform in the age of the internet in order to strengthen both inter-european trading and online privacy. 



2)
    regarding gdpr compliance, there are certain steps in the organisation of the company that must be taken, such as appointing a data protection officer who can ascertain whether the company is complying with current regulations.

    regarding the key principles of gdpr, there are several aspects worth noting.

    - purpose limitation & data minimisation
        the data collected must be the absolute minimum necessary, and it must only be used for the stipulated purposes. the data itself must only be used for displaying to the selected former classmates, and should not, for example, be sold to advertisers or third party companies. 
        
    - accuracy
        in this case the data is self-reported, and so must be kept as accurate to that as possible. there is no way of knowing whether someone's reported salary range is correct, however the data must retain whatever salary range they report.
        
    - accountability & integrity
        there should be an onus on the company itself to keep its security as strong and up to date as possible, as all of the data collected is not only personal, but quite sensitive.

    - liability
        the company itself is at fault were any data to be leaked for any reason, whether through the malicious acts of an external entity, or the incompetence of any members of the company.
