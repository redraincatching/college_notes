assignment 3

    G = { V, E }
        // any graph G can be defined as a set of vectors and edges

    can store tuples (id_1, id_2, d)


logic databases
    incorporate logic and artificial intellignece
    incorporates ideas from armstrong's inference rules
        based on redicate calculus

    allows storing of rules that can infer relations

    uses an implementation of prolog called datalog

    trivial example
        supervise (jim, john)
        supervise (john, jack)
        supervise (jack, joe)

        superior(X,Y) :- supervise (X,Y)
        superior(X,Z) :- supervise(X,Y), superior(Y, Z)

    safety
        a program is said to be safe if it returns a finite set of facts
