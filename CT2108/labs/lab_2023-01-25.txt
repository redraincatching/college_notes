notes:
    arp
        allows the computer to find the mac addresses of other devices on the network
        at minimum needs the router
        displays and modifies the ip-to-physical adress lookup tables used by the address resolution protocol (arp)
        -a
            displays current tables/the arp cache
        -d
            deletes a specified host, and may be wildcarded
            forces the computer to run an arp lookup
    ipconfig
        shows ip configuration
        // note: works on powershell but not git bash
    netstat
        -r
            shows the routing tables

questions from pdf:
    1) arp request message
        source is device asking - Source: IntelCor_bf:1b:ac (f8:59:71:bf:1b:ac)
        destination for a broadcast is all - Destination: Broadcast (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)

    2) ethernet frame type field
        type: ARP (0x0806)
    
    3) ping
        Source Address: 140.203.130.45
        Destination Address: 104.18.143.17

        no ports because icmp doesn't use real ports

    4) examine ping
        icmp type 8 (ping)
        code: 0

    5) ping reply
        icmp type 0 (ping reply)
        code: 0

    6&7) DNS
        sent over udp
        query destination port: 53
        source response also 53
        ip: Destination Address: 172.16.7.141

        usually type a queries
