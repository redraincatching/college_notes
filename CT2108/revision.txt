bit stuffing, data link
    - every 5 1s place a zero, as 111111 is the end-of-frame flag, so avoid that being entered prematurely
    - done at hardware level

hamming distance
    - if two words are distance d apart, will require d single-bit errors to convert one into the other
    - can get it using a bitwise xor

modulation
    - note: can also mean no additional information, just the base
    - 4-level digital system: +/- 45 and +/- 135 degrees

ethernet
    - original DIX format called ether2 in wireshark
    - difference between DIX and ieee 802.3 is the length field is in one, type is in another
    - preamble, sfd, and crc are not found in wireshark, as they're hardware-only
