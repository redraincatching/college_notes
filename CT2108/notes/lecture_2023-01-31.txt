digital subscriber lines

    dsl - opening the phoneline bandwidth above 25 kHz to about 1100 kHz, in 256 4-kHz channels
        // prior to this, it was limited to 0-4 kHz, just for voice
        // the channels were exactly 4312.5 kHz
    DMT - discrete multi tone - modulation was used 

    phone lines are full multiplex, and so the channels were divided between upstream and downstream usage, usually about a 20/80 split, as traffic has a downstream bias

    vdsl vs. dsl
        went from about 1.1 MHz to about 17 MHz, however the usable distance was cut from over a kilometer to a few hundred metres
        [[diagram]]
        just used more channels
        similar to wifi, uses the phoneline as best it can

        standard connector in ireland is an rj11 cable

        fibre to the cabinet (fttc)
            fibre connection to a cabinet on the street, essentially, and vdsl from there
            [[diagram]]

        fibre to the home (ftth)
            mainly use GPON (gigabit passive optical network)
            a single fibre is shared in a typical 64:1 split
                // gpon is 1 gb raw, other variations include the 10 gb xgpon

trunks and data multiplexing
    fdm - frequency division multiplexing
        multiplexing by division of wavelengths
    tdm - time division multiplexing
        timeslice multiplexing

    fdm
        [[diagram]]
        // analog voice telephony is about3 kHz in width
        the principle fm radio is based on, from about 88 to 108 mHz

        wavelength division multiplexing - a variation on this
            [[diagram]]
            the same principle for fibre optics
            // here the combiner and splitter aren't really electronic components, rather precision-engineered optical components

    tdm
        [[diagram]]
        a snippet of the analog signal is sent within a channel of 8 bits (7 data and 1 signal bits) over a 193bit data frame
        this frame takes 125 microseconds to pass
        // this is a T1 frame, in europe we use E1

        [[diagram]]
        the analog signal is first recorded, and encoded into a digital form by sampling it to a certain degree of accuracy (the quantization level)
            based on the idea that all analog signals are happening very slowly relative to the sampling speed
        slight loss of fidelity due to this

        [[diagram]]
        these frame can also be multiplexed into higher-index signals

        voip
            e.g. deskphones in an office
            in ireland we use G.711a codec (coder-decoder)
                // also known as pulse code modulation
                // one of the consequences of nyquist's theorem is that to reproduce an analog signal with a max spectral component of f, you must sample at a minimum rate of 2f
                    -> nyquist sampling rate

                // landlines have a value of 4kHz, and a sampling rate of 8 kHz
                // pcm uses 8 bit samples, 2^8

            2.4 GHz wifi
                has 11 bands, and the bands 1, 6, and 11 (the smallest) don't overlap
                however, all the other bands receiver interference from bluetooth and other devices
            5 GHz wifi
                smaller range, however far less interference, over 400 MHz, with at least 20 non-overlapping channels

    // coax is actually better for this than fibre

    internet over cable
        [[diagram]]
            quicker than vdsl, and the bandwidth is ridiculously massive
            when it comes to fibre, there's no interference, as there is no noise source
        [[diagram]]

    spectrum allocation
        only about 200 MHz is used for downstream data, and about 40 for upstream, as the majority of the spectrum is given over to tv
