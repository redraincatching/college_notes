    has predefined padding and horizontal gutter widths between columns which are customisable, but keep the content uniformly spaced and structured

    rowss must be placed within a .container class for proper alignment and padding
    use rows to create hzl groups of columns

    content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows

    .row and .col are predefined

    columns create gutters via padding, which is offset in the first and last via a negative margin in .row

    grid columns are created by specifying the number of the 12 available columns you wish to span, e.g. .col-4
