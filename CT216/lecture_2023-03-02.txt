firebase auth
    - firebase console and turn it on, basically
    - left with an authentication provider

firebase client libraries
    provides us with client js librarires that we can use to create accounts, log in, etc
    -> should already be installed in the node_modules folder
    -> must be imported to use

    a register method must also be defined

    next step is to add the client libraries to the register webpage, and the event handler for registration
