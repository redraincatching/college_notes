# object interactions with colliders and triggers
objects with colliders and rigidbodies will physically respond to impacts
objects with triggers will not physically interact

// note: triggers are actually just colliders with a special flag

```c#
OnCollisionEnter(Collision coll)   // these happen for collider-to-collider collisions
OnCollisionExit(Collision coll)
OnCollisionStay(Collision coll)
OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)     // these happen for trigger-to-trigger interactions
OnTriggerExit(Collider other)
OnTriggerStay(Collider other)
```

## Collision class
the OnCollision methods receive these objects
member data
- collider
	- the collider object that we hit
- contacts
	- the contact points generated by the physics engine
	- an array of ContactPoint structs
- gameObject
	- that we collided with
- relativeVelocity
	- relative linear velocity of the two colliding objects (Vector3)
- rigibody
	- that we collided with

### ContactPoint struct
collision objects contain an array of these in .contacts
member data
- point
	- point of contact
- normal
	- surface normal at the contact point
- otherCollider
	- the other collider in the collision
- thisCollider
	- the first collider involved in the collision
	- useful if an object has multiple colliders

## PhysicMaterial
allows surfaces to simulate the properties of the material they represent
physics materials can be used to configure friction and bounce
