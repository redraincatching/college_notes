# animators & lights
## animators
used to assign animations to a GameObject
requires a reference to an animation controller, which defines which clips to use, and when & how to blend between them
operates as a finite state machine

## lights
a point light is located at a point in space and sends light out in all directions
the intensity diminished with distance, reaching zero at a specified range

spot lights are generally used for artificial light sources such as headlights, searchlights, or ALAN WAKE'S FLASHLIGHT???

directional lights represent large, distant sources that come from a position outside the range of the game world
