# Electricity

## Electric Circuits
Must form a complete loop back to source (open vs. closed circuit)

---
### Voltage
Work done per unit charge that moves against an electric field
**V = W/Q**

Ideally, a voltage source would be able to provide a constant voltage for any current required by a circuit

*Graph of current over voltage of ideal source*

### Current

Charge past a point per unit time
**I = Q/t**

### Resistance

The opposition to current
**R = V/I**
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ special application of ohm's law

##### Structure of a Resistor
![[excalidraw_12.png]]

###### Wire Resistance
→ usually negligible
**R = ρl / A**
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ R ∝ ρ, l
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ R ∝ A^-1

### Switches

![[excalidraw_13.png]]
*Pole* - the moveable arm of a switch
*Throw* - number of contacts that are affected by a switch action

---
### Multimeter

Measure current in series, voltage in parallel
Analog multimeter - VOM (volt-ohm-miliammeter)

---
##### Resistor Colour Coding
- First band - 1st digit
- Second band - 2nd digit
- Third band - multiplier (10^n)
- Fourth band - tolerance

**\[black - brown - rainbow - grey - white\]**

## Ohm's Law
**V = IR**

---
###### Conductance 
Resistance ^ -1
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ symbol - G
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ measured in Siemens (S), ohms ^ -1, or mho (℧)

---
### Energy, Work, Power
Energy (W) → work, measured in joules (j)
Power (P) → Δwork/t, measured in watts (w) // watt = joule sec^-1

---
#### Units of Electrical Energy

joule
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspunit (kWh, kilowatt hour)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAh (amp hour)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ AA rechargeable, ~ 1500 mAh, 1.2V
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ 1500 mA \* 1.2 V = 1.8 W
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ 1.8 W \* 3600 s = 6480 j

// power "dissipated" = power used

---
#### Resistor Failures
Unusual, except for when subjected to high heat. Visible discolouration in some cases
$\large P = \frac{V^2}{R}$, so lower resistance can lead to much higher heat
