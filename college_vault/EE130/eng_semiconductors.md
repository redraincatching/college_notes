# Semiconductors

crystalline materials (Si, Ge, etc.) that are characterised by *specific energy bands* for electrons betweeen these bands, there are gaps (atomic orbitals) outermost energy band (ground state): valence band the one above that: conduction band

at room temperature, some electrons have enough energy to jump to the conduction band, leaving behind a *hole*

in the conduction band, the electrons are free to drift, causing current to flow

recombination occurs when a conduction-band electron loses energy and "falls" back into a hole

the motion of these electrons and apparent motion of holes act as charge carriers, resulting in current moving in the conduction band due to electrons, and in the valence band due to holes

## Doping

by adding impurities such as Al, Ga, P, or Sb, we can increase or decrease the amount of free electrons and holes, to facilitate certain types of flow

adding boron would result in one more hole per atom, and an n-type conductor
-> (trivalent impurity)

adding phosphorus would result in one moreelectron per atom, and a p-type conductor
-> (pentavalent impurity)

## pn junction

the region where an n-type and p-type semiconductor meet the electrons in the n-type diffuse across the p-type junction, recombining with the holes

this creates a barrier voltage across this section, known as the depletion layer (for silicon, this is about 0.7V)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspâ†’ this means that for electrons to cross this junction, current must be applied

these junctions are known as [[eng_diodes|diodes]]
