logic circuits
    comparison function
        and, or, and not functions can be combined to form various functions
        the comparison function indicates whether a binary value is greater than, equal to, or less than another
            performed by a comparator

    arithmetic functions
    [finish later]

boolean variables
    literal - a variable or its complement
    complement of a variable - its inverse, denoted by a bar above i

    boolean addition
        equivalent to the or operation
        the sum term is 1 if one or more literals is 1, otherwise 0

    boolean multiplication
        equivalent to the and operation
        the product term is 1 if all literals are 1

        // commutative, distributive, and associative laws apply to both of these
        [distributive law diagram]

inverter
    performs the boolean not operation
    gives the complement of the number
    [not example waveform]
