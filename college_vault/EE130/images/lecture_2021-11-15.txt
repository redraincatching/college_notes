rectifiers
    a circuit that converts ac to dc

    half-wave rectifier
        a circuit that eliminates either positive or negative alternations of an input signal
        [insert circuit diagram]
        a diode can be used here, to act as an open during the positive alternation, and as a closed one during the negative alternation

    full-wave rectifier
        a circuit that converts ac to dc by controlling the direction of the output current so that only positive or negative output alternations are produced

    full-wave bridge rectifier
        [circuit diagram]
        based on the principle of switching current paths
        involves an inductor i guess
            wait, no, a transformer
            (f in the diagram is a fuse)

    power supply filters
        filtering is the process of smoothing the ripple from the rectifier
        usually, a capacitor input filter is used
        [circuit diagram]

        the variation in output voltage that occurs as the capacitor is discharging is called the ripple voltage
            the longer the time period between capacitor discharge cycles, the greater the ripple voltage. this is why a filtered full-wave rectifier has less ripple than a comparable half-wave rectifier

    ic regulators
        an integrated chip (ic) is a complete, functional circuit on a silicon chip.
        an ic regulator is one that maintains a constant output current or voltage despite changes in input, load, or temperature.
            most have three terminals; an input, an output, and a reference (or adjust) terminal
                these only require an external capacitor to regulate current - typically a large one before the regulator, and a small one afterwards
                an example of these are the 78xx series regulators [see diagram]
                    the xx is the output voltage

    zener diodes
        a silicon pn junction that differs from a rectifier diode in that it is designed o operate in the breakdown region [see diagram]

    varactor diodes
        a reverse-biased pn junction that utilises the inherent capacitance of the depletion region [see diagram]

    l.e.d.s
        they're l.e.d.s, what more do i say?

    photodiode
        one whose reverse current is controlled by light intensity at the exposed pn junction (proportional)

transistors
    field-effect transistors (FETs)
        in an FET, a narrow conducting channel physically exists or is induced between two leads, called the source and the drain. this channel is either n-type or p-type
        can be npn- or pnp-type

        as the term field-effect implies, conduction in this channel is controlled by an electric field

        JFETs (junction-gate FETs), MOSFETs (metal-oxide semiconductor FETs, also called insulated-gate or IGFETs)
            two types of MOSFETs -> depletion or enhancement MOSFETs, D-MOSFETs or E-MOSFETs

            E-MOSFET
                only operates in the enhancement mode, has no physical channel
                [see diagram]

        MOSFETs are commonly used in digital logic circuits
            these circuits are designed to work with signals that are made up of alternating dc voltage levels, called "logic levels"
            these circuits are made of CMOS - complementary metal-oxide semiconductor - technology

        CMOS inverter
            (changes, by analogue, a 1 to a 0, or a 0 to a 1)
            [see diagram]

analogue quantities
    most natural quantities are analogue, and vary continuously
        digital systems can process this data more efficiently, but can only assign values to each point

digital signals
    a waveform that represents a sequence of discrete values (1s and 0s)
        // also called bit streams

digital modulation
    provides a means of transmitting data from one type to another
    one approach is to modulate the amplitude of a sine wave, called a carrier
    [see diagram]

    pulse-code modulation (pcm)
        uses a sequence of digital codes to represent a sampled analogue signal
        [see diagram]

analogue and digital systems
    many systems use a mix of analogue and digital circuits (e.g. cd player)

binary digits and logic levels
    digital electronics use circuits that have two states, represented by two voltage levels - high and low, representing binary numbers

    digital waveforms change between these two levels

        a positive-going pulse is one that goes from a normally low level to a high one, and then back again
        a negative-going pulse is one that goes from a normally high level to a low one, and then back again

        actual pulses are not ideal square waves, but are described by the rise time, fall time, amplitude, and other characteristics
        [see diagram]

    periodic pulse waveforms
        composed of pulses that repeat in a fixed interval called a period
        the rate that it repeats is the frequency (measured in hertz)
            the clock, the repeating signal used to synchronise others, is a basic example of this

    basic logic functions
        AND - produces a high output only if all inputs are high, performed by an AND gate
        OR - produces a high output if any input is high, performed by an OR gate
        NOT - changes one logic level to another, performed by an inverter
