# Diodes
a [[eng_semiconductors|semiconductor]] with only one pn junction
when a diode is in *forward bias*, current (over the barrier voltage) is permitted to flow.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe bias voltage pushes the electrons across the depletion layer, where they can recombine with holes on the other side
when a diode is in *reverse bias*, the electrons are pushed away from the depletion layer, and current cannot flow
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis causes the depletion layer to increase

*/\* leakage current: some electrons still flow through, due to the large force of the voltage on the reverse bias side, but not much 
breakdown voltage: when too much voltage is applied to a diode in reverse bias, the depletion layer breaks down, and current is able to flow. \*/*

##### Zener Diodes

a silicon pn junction that differs from a rectifier diode in that it is designed to operate in the _breakdown region_

##### Varactor Diodes

a reverse-biased pn junction that utilises the inherent capacitance of the depletion region

##### l.e.d.s

they're l.e.d.s, what else do i need to say?

##### photodiodes

one whose reverse current is controlled by light intensity at the exposed pn junction (proportional)
