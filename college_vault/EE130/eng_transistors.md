# Transistors
## Field-effect Transistors (FETs)
in an FET, a narrow conducting channel physically exists or is induced between two leads, called the source and the drain. this channel is either [[eng_diodes|n-type or p-type]].
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe transistor itself can be npn- or pnp-type

as the term field-effect implies, conduction in this channel is controlled by an _electric field_

### Types of FETs
**JFET**s (junction-gate FETs), **MOSFET**s (metal-oxide semiconductor FETs, also called insulated-gate or IGFETs)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptwo types of MOSFETs -> depletion or enhancement MOSFETs, **D**-MOSFETs or **E**-MOSFETs

#### E-MOSFET
only operates in the enhancement mode, has no physical channel

MOSFETs are commonly used in digital logic circuits

these circuits are designed to work with signals that are made up of alternating dc voltage levels, called [[eng_digital_signals#binary digits and logic levels|"logic levels"]]

these circuits are made of **CMOS** - *complementary metal-oxide semiconductor* - technology

##### CMOS inverter
(changes, by analogue, a 1 to a 0, or a 0 to a 1)
