# programmable logic
[[eng_digital_logic#Programmable Logic Devices|AND array]]
contains a number of and gates that are connected to components via "programmable" links

this is done by identifying the desired input connections to each and gate and removing the others electronically

## SRAM technology
uses cell outputs to turn transistors (links) on or off
a 1 in a cell turns the corresponding link on, and vice versa

// this is volatile

in sum-of-products form (sop), basic combinatorial circuits can be implemented with and-or combinations
