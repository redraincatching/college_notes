# boolean variables
**literal** - a variable or its complement
    complement of a variable - its inverse, denoted by a bar above it

## boolean addition
equivalent to the [[eng_digital_logic|OR]] operation
the sum term is 1 if one or more literals is 1, otherwise 0

## boolean multiplication
equivalent to the [[eng_digital_logic|AND]] operation
the product term is 1 if all literals are 1

// commutative, distributive, and associative laws apply to both of these

#### inverter
