in jakarta, the web.xml file is used to store static params which are useful to the application

data which is common to the whole application and chanegs infrequently, if at all, is defined using \<context-param\>, and data confined to a single servlet is defined using \<init-param\>

web.xml is also used to store params relating to security constraints, session config, other shit like that
