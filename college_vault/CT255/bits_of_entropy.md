# bits of entropy
the average level of uncertainty corresponding to that variable's outcomes 

## formula

$H = log_2(R^L)$ 
- eta = entropy
- R = size of pool of characters
- L = length of password

note that this is a slightly different thing to information entropy. this does ignore the idea of known information and other statistical analysis techniques, meaning
