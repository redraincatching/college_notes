# gdpr
## motivation
cyberattacks are aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money, or interrupting normal business processes
managing data, therefore, may reduce the probability or impact of an attack
gdpr provides such a regulatory framework

gdpr is a binding regulation on eu and european economic area (eea) data protection
also addresses the transfer of data outside of eu and eea
primary aim is to enhance people's control over their own data, and to simplify international business regulation
contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals _located in the eea_

#### what is data protection?
about an individual's fundamental right to privacy
-> the recipient of data has a duty to keep it safe
