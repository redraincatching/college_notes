# Systems in a nutshell

→ application software
→ operating system
→ CPU architecture & microarchitecture
→ sequential + combinatorial logic
→ physics
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp_(each level below enables those above)_
		
**Computer system**
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspinput → **process** → output; _i.e. some useful operation_
	
**System components**
- hardware: physical components
- software: application vs. system, provides instructions to hardware
    -> executes the **fetch → decode → execute** cycle.
---
## Architecture vs Organisation
**Architecture** - attributes of a system visible to a programmer
	_"Can this computer multiply?"_

**Organisation** - operational units and their interconnections that enable architecture. Invisible to a programmer

_"Does the computer multiply directly, or add repeatedly?"_

## Describing Systems
-   Top down approach - starts from whole view, decomposes into subsystems
-   Bottom up approach - start from the bottom, build up a complete description

>Computers are organised _hierarchically_, with each level characterised by structure and function

-   **Structure -** how the components are interconnected
-   **Function -** operation of each component within that structure
