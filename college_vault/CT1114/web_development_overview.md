# Web Development Overview

## HTML - HyperText Markup Language

Defines webpage structure and content - UI
Downloaded by browser from a web server, then rendered by the browser

IDs for tags - whenever you use a tag in HTML, your browser will create a new object with style + content
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp→ give a tag an ID to make it instantly identifiable

## CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

Visual styling of content
Defines the visuals of the HTML page

## Javascript

Programming language that runs in the browser (client side)
Defines behaviour + interactivity of the webpage
Scripting language → lightweight, runs client-side in the browser
"*C-like*", so uses syntax similar to C

### Uses of Javascript

- can read/write form contents (lists, text boxes, etc.)
- can handle events (onClick, onMouseOver, onLoad, etc.)
- can read/write any HTML attributes
