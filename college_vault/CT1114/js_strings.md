# strings
a string is a _group of characters_
a string **literal** is a _group of characters enclosed in quotes_
a string variable is a _variable that holds a string_

// js is loosely typed, so any variable can be any type, but once it has a type, that sticks

the operator + is used to concatenate strings

string handling methods
```js
<var>.length
	// returns the length in characters of a string
<var>.indexOf("<character>")
	// returns the first position that character is found in a string
	// 0-based index
	// indexOf("<character>", <n>) will start looking at position n
<var>.substr(<m>, <n>)
	//returns a portion of the string, starting at position m, and returns n characters
```
