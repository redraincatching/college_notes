# Loops
repeat {blocks of code} as long as condition is true

##### for loops

```jsx
        for (var i=0; i<10; i=i+1) {
            // execute this code
        }

        // three inner statements: (initialisation, test, loop statement)
```

##### while loops
```jsx
        var i = 0, j = 10;
        while (i<j) {
            // do a thing
            i++;    // counter
        }
```
_// note: in js, you only need {} if the block is longer than one line_
