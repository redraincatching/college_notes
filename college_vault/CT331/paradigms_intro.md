# programming paradigms
going to look at three languages
- c
most modern we'll be doing
procedural programming
- lisp
LISt Processing
just functions
one of the worst languages he's ever seen
functional programming
- prolog
programming en logique
french
slow but precise
logical/declarative programming

programming isn't about solving problems, it's about abstracting away from them

## a pattern or model of programming

various types of programming languages, some are better suited to specific problems than others
c is fast and precise, java is higher level but slower
python doesn't compile, so if a piece of code doesn't execute the code just isn't looked at

> often, compilers change syntax, so 2 + 3 would change into a tree with + as the root, and the operands as the leaf nodes

c used to be a multipass language, the compiler would read through the code three times before compiling
recursion was a bit fucky, for example, so early compilers needed to define it
now new compilers just need a function prototype

### syntax
refers to the rules of the language
allows us to form valid expressions and statements
tells you what form the language takes

### semantics
the meanings of those statements

programming languages can be classified according to features they have with respect to conceptual and implementation level
programming paradigms are, essentially, a collection of abstract features that categorise a group of languages

> "the poplarity of a paradigm is due to one community deciding which problems are important to solve, and then supporting the most promising paradigm for attacking those problems"

## influences on paradigms
- computer capabilities
vacuum tubes to transistors to integrated circuits to microcomputers ...
- applications
scientific, business, industrial, entertainment, communication applications
- programming methods
language designs have evolved to reflect changing understanding of good methods for writing large and complex programs
- implementation methods
early compilers to optimised compilers, structured engineering to software engineering, data abstraction to oo
handwritten assembly is slower than compiled c - why? 
-> optimisers
- theoretical studies
formal maths methods have deepened our understanding of strengths and weaknesses of language features and thus influenced the choice and inclusion of those features
- standardisation
has proved to be a strong conservative influence on the evolution of programming language design

> "everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. so if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?"

> "a language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming isn't worth knowing"

## why is learning alternative paradigms useful?
- different paradigms make different tradeoffs
	- what's tricky in one can be almost trivial in another
	e.g. passing functions to other functions in c vs in lisp, or recursion in java vs haskell
- changing paradigms forces you to "change gear"
	- how to reverse an ordered list in java? c? scheme? prolog?
- it may become mainstream
	- oop was once an alternative paradigm
- alternative paradigms influence the mainstream
	- garbage collection came from functional programming
- will prepare you for learning languages you haven't heard of / that don't exist yet
- help you compare languages & find the best tool for the job
- help you understand languages more deeply

### why learn functional programming?
- one of the oldest paradigms (lisp: 1958, still widely used)
- heavily based on mathematical concepts (proofs, lambda calculations)
- elegant solutions (recursion)
- other paradigms can be interpreted in terms of functional programming

good at symbols, bad at numbers
logical structures and stuff

### why learn logical programming?
- long history
- allows implementation that are very difficult in other paradigms
- VERY different
- helps to conceptualise logical problems

// data and code aren't different, data is just code that doesn't do anything
// interpreted, not compiled, so very slow

### why learn imperative programming?
- earliest paradigm - as far back as punch cards and magnetic loops
// older, even, see jacquard 
- much closer representation of how the machine actually works
- can help to recognise some computational bottlenecks and optimisation issues
- contextualises other systems like unix, linux

### why learn oop?
- don't
- oop tries to represent real-world constraints
- uses abstraction and inheritance

---
## OOP

### fundamentals of oop
- everything is an object
- computation is performed by message passing
- every object is an instance of a class which is a grouping of similar objects
- inheritance describes the relationship between classes

oop focuses on the objects the code represents and the behaviours they exhibit

### 4 major principles of oop
- encapsulation
- abstraction
- inheritance
- polymorphism

#### encapsulation
data is hidden as if "encapsulated" within the object
- direct access to data is restricted
- we use methods to get, set, and manipulate that data
object callers don't need to know what's going on behind the scenes

#### abstraction
functionality can be defined without being implemented
- high-level interfaces provide methods types/names without implementation
- allow case-specific implementation
- allows one programmer to define functionality, and another to implement
- allows representation to be changed without affecting the "public" view of a class
helpful when designing large systems, if i can write an interface for a function and be sure that it will return a String, i can keep writing my code and not worry about implementing it right now

#### inheritance
- code can inherit functionality without re-implementing
- prevents code duplication
- encourages well-structured codebase

#### polymorphism
poly, meaning many
morphism, meaning shape

objects of one class can be treated as others
an object of type \<Bike\> can be cycled
an object of type \<RacingBike\> can also be cycled
two \<Number\>s, say an int and a float, can be added and subtracted as if they were the same type

## imperative programming
e.g. assembly (also fortran and sometimes basic)
- list of instructions
- GOTO statements
- little or no structure

telling the computer to perform a set of actions, one after the other
most programming languages have imperative aspects

// moves through statements one after another

---

## procedural programming
e.g. c, pascal, ada (also fortran and basic, sometimes)
// ada is like multi-threading pascal
- code is structured
- uses functions, or procedures
// procedural functions are distinct from functional programming
- encourages code re-use
- encourages encapsulation and composition

splits actions into procedures or tasks
procedures can be made up of other procedures (composition, recursion...)

// "has functions"

---
## structured programming
basically everything but assembly

- code is structured
- while, for, if, else, switch, class, function, etc.
- less emphasis on GOTO
- creating a structure to manage instructions
- allows more complex programs to be built
- easier to understand
- avoids GOTO bugs and spaghetti code
