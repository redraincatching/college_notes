# polymorphism
the ability of a class to provide different implementations of a method, depending on the type of object that is passed to the method

the facility by which an object can be referenced by a variable of its superclass

## dynamic dispatch / late binding
the decision as to which method is invoked is decided at runtime, not compile time
example: the array of type animal
