# Algorithms

A finite set of instructions that give a sequence of operations for solving a specific problem

### Problem Solving with Algorithms

1.  Clarify the problem, specify any simplifications/assumptions made 
2.  Specify inputs and corresponding outputs
3.  Specify test cases
4.  Work through with sample data/test cases - "verbalise"
5.  Specify more formally in code
6.  Test
7.  Refactor for efficiency
8.  Document & explain
