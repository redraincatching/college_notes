# problem solving in computing
- clarify the problem
-> understand what is being asked, make and specify any simplifications/assumptions necessary
- specify some of the inputs (number, type, etc.)
- calculate some expected outputs
- try working through solution steps with same data
- specify solution more formally, calculate time complexity
- convert solution to full code
- error check + debug
- test
- document

## algorithms
set of instructions for solving problems

to understand an algorithm, we have to understand:
- why it works
- how it works
- how efficient it is - time and space
- how to modify it to improve performance
- why in some cases, improving efficiency is difficult or impossible

=="efficient solution"==
- correctness
checked by test cases, or possibly even formal proofs
- time taken
faster is generally considered better
- amount of space/memory used
less space/memory/data calls used is better
- simplicity + clarity
the more clear, consistent, and readable your code, the better
makes it very easy for others (or yourself, later) to maintain your code
- optimality

efficiency is based on a large number of factors, but the only one we're concerned with is the construction of the program
