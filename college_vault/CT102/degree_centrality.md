#### degree centrality
_degree_: number of edges a node has
if directed, it is possible to distinguish between _indegree_ and _outdegree_
often these measures are averaged over the total graph

-> the ratio of in and out degrees to averages are often used to give a measure of an individualâ€™s influence

degrees can be calculated by row/column summation in a matrix
