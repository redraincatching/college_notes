r syntax
    # - section heading
    ## - subsection
    ...
    **word** - bold
    _word_ - italics
    ```code goes here``` - code chunk
    ```(r)``` - r chunk
    * words - bullet points

    // supports latex, i think


code chunks
    echo=FALSE
        doesn't display the code chunk, only the output, default true
    
    // code can also be inserted inline using single backticks
    //   `mean(somedata)` inserts the code
    //   `r mean(somedata)` runs it
    


knit
    essentially "compiling" the r code

statistical methods
    descriptive and inferential statistics
        descriptive
            science of numerically or graphically summarising data
        inferential
            science of using information about the sample to infer something about the population of interest

        population
            a _parameter_ is a single value summarising some variable of interest in the population
        sample
            a _statistic_ is a single value summarising the observed values of the variable from the sample  

    sampling variation
        a consequence of natural variation is that two samples taken from the same popuation will usually produce different estimates of the population parameters

        non-probabilistic sampling
            "convenience sampling"
            techniques of obtaining a sample that do not involve randomness
            may be subject to sampling bias
                issues:
                    a response may be more likely to be recieved if a responder has a particularly strong opinion

        simple random sampling
            "subset of n units from a population of N units, chosen randomly so that every unit has the same chance of being selected"
