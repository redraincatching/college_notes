the "internet"
    - each ip block is routed by a single network
    - a network may have many ip blocks, but not the other way around
    - each network is described by an autonomous sytsem (as) number

bgp
    border gateway protocol
    designed to route between as'

    1989, rfc 1105 - bgp
    1990, rfc 1163 - bgp2
    1991, rfc 1267 - bgp3
    1995, rfc 1654, rfc 1771, rfc 4271, ... - bgp4

    bgp is an exterior gateway protocol
        sets up inter-as routing
        also, in terms of data centre managers like amazon, used internally

        // ospf is an igp

    bgp allows one as to signal to others the ip prefixes that can be reached through it
    these nlri (network layer reachability information) messages go to peers or neighbours of the as

    three main types of peers
        - transit
            you are the customer to an upstream isp
        - peering
            normally settlmenent free, ixp or pni
        - customer
            you are the isp providing downstream connectivity
            
    default route
        gateway of last resort
    default free zone
        the "full" routing table, no default route

    differences to ospf
        - no topological information, so no shortest paths
