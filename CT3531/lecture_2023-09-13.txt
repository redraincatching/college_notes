802.1q tag fields
    - tag protocol identifier
        value 0x8100 identifies 802.1q tag
    - user priority
        can be used to prioritise data (e.g. voice, data)
        0 lowest
        generally not used
    - canonical format indicator
        used for compatibility between different types of mac protocols
    - vlan identifier (vid)
        specifies vlan (1-4094)
        0x000 indicates the frame does not belong in a vlan
        vlan 1 reserved for management traffic
        0xfff also reserved

vlan tags
    normal operation
        - sender sends frame
        - first switch adds tag
        - last switch removes tag


avoiding loops and broadcast storms
    if loops exist in the topology, switches can end up forwarding traffic around in circles indefinitely
    to avoid this, all switches use the spanning tree protocol (stp)
        superseded now by rapid spanning tree, rstp
