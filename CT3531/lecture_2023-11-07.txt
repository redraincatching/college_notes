network programming
    sockets
        developed as a BSD Unix abstraction to allow users to write programs that utilise the underlying comms protocols
        unrelated processes can use them to communicate across a network
        it's an endpoint to which a "name" (i.e. a port) can be bound
        allows programs to be largely independent of lower protocols

        the socket api provides access to an ipc mechanism
        mostly just using udp/ip and tcp/ip

        java sockets
            java.net
            supports two types of communication
                socket-based communication
                    - views networking as a stream
                    - connection-based
                    - uses tcp
                packet-based communication
                    - individual packets transmitted
                    - connectionless
                    - uses udp
