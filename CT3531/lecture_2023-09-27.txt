[[todo: fill in the start of the naming and addressing slides]]

supernetting
    [[diagram]]
    move the prefix to the left to cover more ip ranges
    in this example, the router has control of four /16 subnets
    instead of sending that all on, the router sends the core network a single /14 address that covers all the subnets and handles the inner routing itself

    saves space in routing tables and speeds up transfers

naming guidelines
    - short
    - meaningful
    - unambiguous
    - distinct
    - case insensitive

domain name system (dns)
    maps names to ip addresses
    supports hierarchical naming
        e.g. frodo.rivendell.middle-earth.com

        /*
            aside: fully qualified domain names
                two types of dns records
                    - a-records give ipv4
                    - aaaa-records (quad-a) five ipv6
            
                names have nothing to do with routing, so before any transfer takes place, you have to query a dns server for the ip

                fqdm - the full name with a . at the end
                    e.g. www.google.com.
                
                normally not seen unless you're fucking about with zone files in a dns server
                that last . is the root, and everything else derives from that

                .ie, .com are top-level domains, sitting just below the root

                some servers will act as authoritative sources for the root
                    i.e. have authoritative zone files
                some will then have a tld, e.g. .ie
                more specified ones will have the actual websites, like universityofgalway.ie

                dns servers can work recursively, so a top-level dns server will query another server with the tld, which will query lower and so forth

                two types of dns servers
                    - authoritative
                    - recursive

                the authoritative act as administrators, and only has data for the zones it administers
                the recursive can traverse through these graphs to find the specified names, and can cache large amounts of information for significant lengths of time
                    // the network administrator of an auth. server will decide how long their records can be cached
        */

    a dns server has a database of resource records that maps names to addresses in the server's "zone of authority"
    client queries server
        - uses udp port 53 for name queries and replies
        - uses tcp port 53 for zone transfers


    dns details
        uses a client/server model
        client is configured with the ip address of a dns server
            // manually or provided by dhcp
        dns resolver software on the client machine sends a queryto the dns server

    // wifi routers can act as minor dns resolvers for their lan
