packet filters and firewalls
    a packet filter is a piece of software which looks at the header of incoming packets to decide its fate
        - ACCEPT
        - DROP
        - something more complicated

    on linux, packet filtering is built into the kernel

    functions
        - control
            allow only packets you are interested in to pass through
        - security
            reject malicious packets
                ping of death, external telnet
        - watchfulness
            log packets in/out

    packet filters under linux
        - ipfw
            1st generation, from BSD
        - ipfwadm
            2nd gen, from linux 2.0
        - ipchains
            3rd gen, linux 2.2
        - iptables
            4th gen, linux 2.4

    iptables
        kernel starts with three lists of rules called firewall chains
            - INPUT
            - FORWARD
            - OUTPUT

            each rule says, essentially, "if the header looks like this, do this"

        when a packet first comes in, the packet looks at the destination and header - routing decision
        if destined for the current process, pass to input
            it will then be passed to the
