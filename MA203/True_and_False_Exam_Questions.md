##### A system of 4 equations in three unknowns cannot have a solution
- False
- The 4 equations could be the same and thus have infinite solutions

##### $3x + 3y -2z = 0$ is the equation of a plane through the origin in $R^3$ with the normal vector $(3, 3, -2)$
- True
- (0, 0, 0) is on the plane
- $ax + by + cz = d$ is the equation of a plane with normal (a, b, c)
- Here the normal is parallel to (3, 3, -2)

##### It is possible to determine if two lines in $R^3$ intersect by solving an appropriate system of equations
- True
- Line 1: $r_1(t) = r_1(0) + tv$
- Line 2: $r_2(s) = r_2(0) + su$
- Let $r_1(t) = r_2(s)$ and solve a system of equations in two unknowns

##### Elementary row operations do not change the determinant of a matrix
- False
- If two rows are added, the determinants are added
- If two rows are interchanged, the determinant changes sign
- However, the determinant does not change when one row is subtracted from another
- Also, if two rows in the matrix are equal, the determinant is zero

##### Any set of three linearly independent vectors in $R^3$ is a basis for $R^3$
- True
- Any set of linearly independent vectors in a space forms a basis for that space

##### If a square matrix A is invertible, then the rows of A are linearly independent
- False
- The matrix must be invertible and have full rank in order for the columns and rows to be linearly independent

##### If 0 is an eigenvalue of a square matrix A, then A has no inverse matrix
- True
- If 0 is an eigenvalue it means there is a non-zero value in the kernel
- For a square matrix, being invertible is the same as having kernel {0}

##### If the characteristic polynomial of a $3 × 3$ matrix A is $P(λ) = λ^3 − 6λ^2 + 11λ − 6$, then 2 is an eigenvalue of A.
- True
- Solve for $P(λ) = 0$ where $λ = 2$
- This is because the characteristic polynomial = 0 will give you the eigenvalues
- This is because of the property that $(A - λI)$ cannot be an invertible matrix to avoid having an eigenvector be the zero vector
- And as above non-invertible matrices have a determinant of zero and the characteristic polynomial is the $(A - λI)$

##### Any non-zero multiple of an eigenvector of an n × n matrix A is also an eigenvector of A
- True
- This is just the way eigenvectors are

##### If the rows of a square matrix A are linearly dependent, then A is not invertible
- False
- As long as the matrix has full rank, A is invertible

##### A 3 × 3 matrix can have four distinct eigenvalues
- False
- A matrix can have no more eigenvalues than it does columns

##### $2x + 3y − 5z = 2$ is the equation of a plane through the origin in $R^3$
- False
- The vector (0, 0, 0) is not in this plane

##### If a system of linear equations has a square coefficient matrix A with nonzero determinant, then it has a unique solution
- True
- If the determinant is zero then it has an infinite number of solutions
