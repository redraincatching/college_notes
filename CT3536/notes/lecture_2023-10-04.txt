guis & multi-scene project interfaces
    most games benefit from manually configured scenes which are switched as the game runs
        // dynamic instantiation still necessary within scenes

    the scenemanager provides methods to switch between these

    to load a scene
        using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;
        SceneManager.LoadScene("scene4");

        when a scene is loaded, all previously loaded objects are destroyed
            // it is possible to load asynchronously and have a loading screen
        
        to get an object to survive this transition, use DontDestroyOnLoad
            // often used for singletons that carry data across scenes
