latex introduction
    documentation preparation system for high quality typesetting
        used in scientific or technical writing, but can be used for any
        purpose

    mechanism of latex
        [see notepad]

    usage
        MiKTeX - offline editor
        overleaf - cloud-based editor

    // templates can be found on github, but this is a premium feature
    // overleaf has a search function for templates

format of a document
    preamble
        document class
        packages
    front matter
        title
        author
    body
        contents
    back matter
        bibliography

                // can be simplified to just preamble and body

latex syntax
    all keyword commands begin with a backslash \
    all parameters and arguments are passed with braces {}
    comments can be added using the % character

    // sample text
        \documentclass{article}
        \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}        %preamble section
        [do this later]

    reserved characters
        some characters need an escape character, as they have another function
        in latex
            generally, \ works as an escape character

            e.g. $ opens math mode
                 \$ prints a $

    shortcuts
        ctrl + space - autocomplete reference (inside a \cite block)
        ctrl + enter - recompile

    after you make any changes, you need to recompile to see changes on the pdf

    packages
        mhchem: chemical molecular formulas and equations
        tikz: visualisation tool
