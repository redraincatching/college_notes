kinematics + dynamics
    kinematics
        a branch of classical mechanics which describes the motion of objects without consideration of the circumstances leading to the motion, i.e., without reference to forces

    dynamics
        motion in one direction

    displacement
        (unit: metre, m)
        vector that specifies the position of a particle in reference to a previous position
        formula: \sqrt{\delta x^2 + \delta y^2}
        not always equivalent to distance travelled

    speed
        scalar quantity, time derivative of distance

    velocity
        vector quantity, time derivative of displacement
