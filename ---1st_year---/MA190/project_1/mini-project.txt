    the collatz problem
        construct a sequence as follows:
            the first term is a positive integer n that you choose. subsequent terms are defined by
            - if the last number introduced was even, halve it
            - if the last number was odd, multiply by three and add one
            - repeat

        question - does it always end in repetitions of 4, 2, 1?

    divisibility by 7 trick - chika ofili, 2019 (professional 12 year old)
        positive number is a multiple of 7 if and only if the following operation is a multiple of 7
            - delete the last digit a, leaving the integer b
            - take the number b + 5a
                -> can be repeated until the number is easily recognised, but holds for all.

    neusis construction in classical greek geometry
        // noy-sis
        if l and m are (non-parallel) lines in the plane, and p is a point, and t is a fixed length, the neusis construction allows for the construction of a line segment of length t, that has one end each on l and m, and points towards p. it allows for some geometric constructions that would otherwise be impossible, such as trisecting an angle
            // note: mathematical origami?
            based on classical greek attempts to draw stuff with only a compass and straight-edge, and going beyond those constraints

    P vs NP
        famous unsolved problem in complexity theory
        a problem is classified as P (polynomial time) if there is an algorithm that will provide a solution in a time that is a polynomial function of the input
        a problem is classified as NP (non-deterministic polynomial time) if there is an algorithm that will check a proposed solution in a time that is a polynomial function of the input
        it is plausible to suppose that there are problems in the second category, but not the first, however, no one has found one yet.

    happy numbers
        numbers are happy in a base b if its the sum of its digits squared eventually add up to 1
