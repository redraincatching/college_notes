logic
    the study of methods to reason validly, obtaining justified conclusions from assumed premises
    the atoms of logic are called propositions - statements that can have only one binary truth value - a boolean value

    connectives
        ∧ - and (*, &)
        ∨ - or  (+, ||)
        ¬ - not (!)
        → - implies (if … then …)

        * and + are binary operators, ! is unary
        * is commutative
        + is commutative and associative
