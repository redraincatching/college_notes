variations of p → q

    q → p is the converse of p → q
    ¬p → ¬q is the inverse of p → q
    ¬q → ¬p is the contrapositive of p → q

        /*
        note:
            p → q ≡ ¬q → ¬p
            converse ≡ inverse
            an implication is not equivalent to its converse; hence is not equivalent to its inverse

predicates
    set theory
        a set is a collection of elements (we assume no other structure)
        let S be a set.
            if x is an element of S, we write x ∈ S
            if not, we write x ∉ S
        each set is specified entirely by its elements
        thus, two sets A and B are equal (A = B) if and only if a ∈ A implies a ∈ B, and b ∈ B implies b ∈ A
            // A = B ↔ (a∈A → a∈B)*(b∈B → b∈A)

        standard notation expresses the elements that define the set in some explicit way, usually in braces, e.g.
            S = {x, y, z}; {a ∈ Z | a is divisible by two}; ∅

        a set is finite if it has a finite number of elements

        a predicate is a type of function, P(x) that becomes a proposition (i.e. has a boolean value) when x is replaced by a value in its domain
            e.g.
                let E(n) be the predicate “n is even”, where n ∈ Z.
                -> E(14) ≡ 1; E(13) ≡ 0

            predicates may have more than one variable

    predicates may also be turned into propositions by quantification
        universal quantification
            "∀x ∈ S, P(x)"
            this states "for all elements x of S, P(x) has value T"
        existential quantification
            "∃x ∈ S, P(x)"
            this states "there exists an element x of S, for which the proposition P(x) has value T"

        note:
        - ∃x ∈ S, P(x) ≡ P(x_0) + P(x_1) + P(x_2) + …
        - ∀x ∈ S, P(x) ≡ P(x_0) * P(x_1) * P(x_2) * …

        negations of quantifiers
            a universal quantifier negates to an existential one, and vice versa
                ¬(∀x ∈ S, P(x)) ≡ ∃x ∈ S, ¬P(x).
                ¬(∃x ∈ S, P(x)) ≡ ∀x ∈ S, ¬P(x).

            for example:
                "not all martians are green" ≡ "there are martians who are not green"
                "it's not true that some martians are green" ≡ "no martians are green"
