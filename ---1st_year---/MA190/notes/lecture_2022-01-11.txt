implication
    a → b
    if statement a is true, then b is true

    a | b | a→b
    ------------
    0 | 0 |  1      // "vacuously" true
    0 | 1 |  1      // means conclusion can be independent of premise
    1 | 0 |  0      // can never be true, "if a then b" and a, !b, then contradictory
    1 | 1 |  1      // well, yeah

        /*
        1 can never imply 0
        0 can imply anything
        */

biconditional conjective
    a ↔ b
    "if and only if", iff

    essentially, (a→b)*(b→a)


    a | b | a↔b
    ------------
    0 | 0 |  1
    0 | 1 |  0
    1 | 0 |  0
    1 | 1 |  1

tautologies and contradictions
    tautology - a statement that is always true, no matter the propositions
        e.g. a+!a

    contradictions - a statement that is similarly always false
        e.g. a*!a

logical equivalence
    statements are logically equivalent (≡) if they have the same truth values for each assignment of truth values to constituent propositions
    otherwise, they are not (≡/≡)

    some important equivalencies
        a ∧ (b ∨ c) ≡ (a ∧ b) ∨ (a ∧ c)
        a ∨ (b ∧ c) ≡ (a ∨ b) ∧ (a ∨ c)

    de morgan's laws
         ¬(a ∨ b) ≡ ¬a ∧ ¬b
         ¬(a ∧ b) ≡ ¬a ∨ ¬b

         // note: it can be demonstrated that each of these laws follow from the other
