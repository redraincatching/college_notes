common logical fallacies
    both of these are provably false, by truth table

    converse fallacy
        p → q, q, ∴ p

    inverse fallacy
        p → q, ¬p,  ∴ ¬q


set theory
    a set is completely determined by the elements it contains
    a set B is a subset of set A if each element of B is also an element of A
    in this case, we write B ⊆ A
    thus, A = B iff A ⊆ B && B ⊆ A

    all sets are assumed to be subsets of U, the universal set
    a set is finite if it has a finite number of elements
        // the size, or cardinality, of a finite set is the number of elements it contains

    let A, B ⊆ U
        - the union of A and B
            A ∪ B := {x ∈ U | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}       // logical OR
        - the intersection of A and B
            A ∩ B := {x ∈ U | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}      // logical AND
        - the set difference of A and B
            A\B := {x ∈ U | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}        // and B\A is the reverse
        - the complement of A
            A' := {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}                   // logical NOT

    various identities
        - A ∩ A' = ∅
        - A ∪ A' = U
        - U' = ∅
        - ∅' = U
