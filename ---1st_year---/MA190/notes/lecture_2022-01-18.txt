arguments
    an argument is a list of statements, ending in a conclusion
    more formally, a logical argument is a list of statements (p_0, p_1, p_2, …, p_n), ∴ c, where p_1, …, p_n are the premises, and c is the conclusion

    an argument is valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises

    logical forms of arguments
        there is a subtle difference between "logically valid" and a "valid argument", but that requires a greater understanding of maths than i currently have

        an argument can be expressed as a boolean function
            // propositional calculus
        an argument is "logically valid" if, when expressed as a function, it _always_ outputs 1
        for example:
            "if i get a bonus, i will buy a bike. if i sell my old car, i will buy a bike. i will sell my car or get a bonus. therefore, i will buy a bike"

            p: i buy a bike
            q: i get a bonus
            r: i sell my car

            // the argument itself
            {(q → p) ^ (r → q) ^ (q ∨ r)} → q

            by using a truth table, we can see that this expression will always evaluate to 1, therefore it is logically valid
