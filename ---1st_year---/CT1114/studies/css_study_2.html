    <h2>kubla khan</h2>
    <p class="par" onclick="colour_change(this);" style="color:#ff0000;">
    in xanadu did kubla khan<br>
    a stately pleasure-dome decree:<br>
    where alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
    through caverns measureless to man<br>
    down to a sunless sea.
    </p>
    <p class="par" onclick="colour_change(this);" style="color:#00ff00;">
    so twice five miles of fertile ground<br>
    with walls and towers were girdled round;<br>
    and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,<br>
    where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;<br>
    and here were forests ancient as the hills,<br>
    enfolding sunny spots of greenery.
    </p>
    <p class="par" onclick="colour_change(this);" style="color:#00ff00;">
    but oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted<br>
    down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!<br>
    a savage place! as holy and enchanted<br>
    as e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted<br>
    by woman wailing for her demon-lover!<br>
    and from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,<br>
    as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing.
