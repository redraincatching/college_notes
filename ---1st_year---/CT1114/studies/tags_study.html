        <h1> The Rime of the Ancient Mariner </h1>
        <h3> By Samuel Taylor Coleridge </h3>

        <p>
            &nbsp;It is an ancient Mariner,<br>
            And he stoppeth one of three.<br>
            'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,<br>
            Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,<br>
            And I am next of kin;<br>
            The guests are met, the feast is set:<br>
            May'st hear the merry din.'
        </p>

            <li> This is, of course, not the whole poem </li>
            <li> It's just two verses </li>
            <li> But I'd recommend reading the rest! </li>
