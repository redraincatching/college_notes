images in html
    added with the empty tag <img>, and require a source (src) attribute with the url of the image
        url can be absolute or relative

the window
    represents an open window in a browser
    a window is an object, which means that it has attributes, and methods
        methods are things that an object can do
            sample window methods
                - alert
                - prompt
                - confirm
                - setTimeout

    methods:
        //  methods are called using <object>.<method>
            // that's how you access anything belonging to an object
        alert
            displays a modal dialog box containing a message
                // modal means it must be acknowledged before anything else can take place
            takes a string argument
            syntax
                window.alert("<text>");
                alert("<text>");    // both work
                    // window is implicit, as all of your code belongs to the window
        prompt
            prompts the user to enter input via a modal dialog box
            e.g.
                var result = window.prompt("<prompt_text>", "<default_field_value>");
                    // note: the second argument is optional

            // note: prompt has a return value
