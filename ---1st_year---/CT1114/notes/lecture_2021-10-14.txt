expressions, operators, and loops in javascript

expressions
    a statement that evaluates to a value
        -> can be a number, a string, or a boolean

boolean value
    either true or false
    a boolean expression is one that evaluates to either true or false
        often produced by relational or logical operators

relational operators
    take two values, compare then, output a boolean variable
    (c-like)

logical operators
    && - AND
        equates to true if both boolean values are true
    || - OR
        equates to true if one or both values are true
    ! -  NOT
        negates the value of a boolean variable

conditional statements
    if... else if... else
    switch statements
        all c-like, use {braces} to denote code blocks

loops
    repeat {blocks of code} as long as  condition is true

    for loops
        repeat code a specified amount of times

        // javascript syntax
        for (var i=0; i<10; i=i+1) {
            // execute this code
        }

        // three inner statements: (initialisation, test, loop statement)

    while loops
        repeat code an undetermined amount of times, while a condition is true

        // js syntax
        var i = 0, j = 10;
        while (i<j) {
            // do a thing
            i++;    // counter
        }
