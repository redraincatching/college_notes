string methods
    .split()
        splits a string into an array of substrings, made according to the given delimiter argument
        // note: the contents of a textarea are not html, so escape characters are required

    .sort()
        sorts an array
        with no argument -> sorts alphabetically, even numbers
        with an argument -> sorts using a custom function

            .sort(compare_function)
                sending the function as an argument (no round brackets, it's not being executed)
                this function is called whenever the sort function wants to compare two elements
                compare_function is sent the two elements as arguments, and should return
                    - a negative number if unsorted
                    - a positive number if sorted
                    - a 0 if the numbers are equal

                // in this case, compare_function is referred to as a "callback"
                // less sending the function itself, more sending its location in memory
