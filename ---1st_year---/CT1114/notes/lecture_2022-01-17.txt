arrays in js
    c-like, [] brackets
    random-access data structure - can access any data point at any time

    differences between js and c
        js can have "sparse" arrays, i.e. can have gaps
        can be indexed on strings as well as integers
        each element can contain any type of data (even functions)
            // all of these seem prime for fuckery

    sample array code
        var a = []           // create an empty array
        a.push(22);          // .push adds an element at the end of the array
        a.splice(10,1);      // .splice removes 1 element from position 10, and shifts the rest down
        a["exit"] = "amach"  // sets an element at the index "exit"
        a.length;            // returns the index of the last element (doesn't make much sense here)

    "undefined" data type
        the data type of variables that don't exist
        useful for checking if an element is in an array

    hash tables
        [diagram]
        a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.
        javascript actually implements arrays like this internally

    iterating through arrays
        dense, integer-indexed arrays ("normal" arrays)
            for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
                // do thing
            }

        sparse or string-indexed arrays
            for (var i in a) {
                // do thing
            }
