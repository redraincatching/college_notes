programmable logic
    AND array
        contains a number of and gates that are connected to components via "programmable" links
        this is done by identifying the desired input connections to each and gate and removing the others electronically

    SRAM technology
        uses cell outputs to turn transistors (links) on or off
        a 1 in a cell turns the corresponding link on, and vice versa
        [diagram]
        this is volatile

combinational logic circuits
    in sum-of-products form (sop), basic combinatorial circuits can be implemented with and-or combinations
