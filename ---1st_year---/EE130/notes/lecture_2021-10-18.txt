circuits
    represent systems as connected elements
        - through which currents flow (through variables)
        - and across which voltages develop (across variables)

    circuits are important for two reasons
        - as physical systems (power, electronics)
        - as models of complex systems (neurons, cardiovascular systems)

    all circuits have three common attributes
        - a voltage source
        - a load
        - a complete path

a series circuit is one that only has one current path
    - because there is only one path, the current everywhere is the same
    - the total resistance is the sum of the resistors in series
    - the total voltage in series is the algebraic sum of voltages

kirchhoff's voltage law (kvl)
    - the sum of all voltage drops around a closed loop is equal to the total
      source voltage in that closed path
    - planar circuits are characterised by their "inner" loops, as those are
      linearly independent
    - the sign of a voltage is defined by its bias - the "entering" sign is
      placed before the voltage

voltage divider rule
    the voltage drop across any given resistor in a sries circuit is equal to
    the ratio of that resistor to the total resistance, times the source
    voltage.

voltage is relative, and is measured with respect to another point in the
circuit
    voltage with respect to ground (called reference ground) is written with
    one subscript
        e.g. V_a    // voltage at a with respect to ground
    voltage between two points is written with two subscripts
        e.g. V_ab   // voltage between a and b

    ground reference is not always the lowest point in the circuit
        in that case, any drops below ground are written as -ve
