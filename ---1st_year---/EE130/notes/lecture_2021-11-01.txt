kirchoff's current law
    sum i in = sum i out
    number of linearly independent kcl equations is one less than the total number of nodes

current divider rule
    i (at node x) = ( r total in parallel / r(x) ) i total

resistance of two parallel resistors
    r_t = (r1.r2)/(r1 + r2)

series-parallel circuits
    equivalent circuits
        a circuit with electrical characteristics that are the same as another circuit, but is simpler

loaded voltage divider
    voltage divider where another resistor (the load resistor) is added in parallel with a resistor in the voltage divider (the bleeder resistor)
        this changes the voltage ratio in the voltage divider

    stiff voltage divider
        provides a load voltage that is nearly equal to its no-load output voltage
            this is achieved by having a load resistor that is > 10*r_b.
                // current wants to take the path of least resistance, so to keep the voltage similar to the no-load, we make sure that the added load resistance is massive

    voltmeter loading effect
        occurs whenever we measure a voltage, as a voltmeter has an internal resistance, causing a loading effect, resulting in the measurement being slightly off

            example formula
                v_vm = ((r_1 || r_vm) / r_total) * v_total

    wheatstone bridge
        four resistive arms forming two voltage dividers
            galvanometer in between them
