thÃ©venin's theorem
    any two-terminal, resistive circuit can be replaced with a simple equivalent circuit when viewed from two output terminals

semiconductors
    crystalline materials (Si, Ge, etc.) that are characterised by specific energy bands for electrons
    betweeen these bands, there are gaps (atomic orbitals)
    outermost energy band (ground state): valence band
    the one above that: conduction band

    at room temperature, some electrons have enough energy to jump to the conduction band, leaving behind a hole
        in the conduction band, the electrons are free to drift, causing current to flow
    recombination occurs when a conduction-band electron loses energy and "falls" back into a hole

    the motion of these electrons and apparent motion of holes act as charge carriers, resulting in current moving in the conduction band due to electrons, and in the valence band due to holes

    doping
        by adding impurities such as Al, Ga, P, or Sb, we can increase or decrease the amount of free electrons and holes, to facilitate certain types of flow
            adding boron would result in one more hole, and an n-type semiconductor
                (trivalent impurity)
            adding phosphorus would result in one less hole, and a p-type conductor
                (pentavalent impurity)

    pn junction
        the region where an n-type and p-type semiconductor meet
        the electrons in the n-type diffuse across the p-type junction, recombining with the holes
            this creates a barrier voltage across this section, known as the depletion layer
            (for a silicon diode, this is about 0.7V)
                -> this means that for electrons to cross this junction, current must be applied

diodes
    a semiconductor with a single pn junction

    when a diode is in forward bias, current (over the barrier voltage) is permitted to flow.
        the bias voltage pushes the electrons across the depletion layer, where they can recombine with holes on the other side
    when a diode is in reverse bias, the electrons are pushed away from the depletion layer, and current cannot flow
        this causes the depletion layer to increase
            /*
            leakage current: some electrons still flow through, due to the large force of the voltage on the reverse bias side, but not much
            breakdown voltage: when too much voltage is applied to a diode in reverse bias, the depletion layer breaks down, and current is able to flow. this ruins the diode
            */
