numbering systems

first slide
    overview of numbering systems
        - know the different numbering systems
        - describe positional notation
        - convert other bases to base 10
        - describe the relationship between bases 2, 8, and 16
        - deal with fractions in other bases
        - negative number representation
            - (sign bit vs. complementary notation)

second slide
        number categories - natural, negative, irrational, etc.
        definition of a number as relates to computer science
            unit belonging to an abstract mathematical system subject to
            specified laws of succession, addition, and multiplication

third slide
    concept of a base
        the number of digits used in a numbering system
        we use decimal, base 10, in our everyday lives
            base 10 = 10 digits
                (0, 1, 2, [...], 9)
            base <anything>
                (0, 1, 2, [...], <anything - 1>)
        subscript indicates base
        base is also what dictates positional value

fourth slide
    decimal vs. binary vs. octal vs. hexadecimal
        e.g. (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11...)

fifth slide
    positional value
        each position has a place value, starting at 0 on the right
        [diagram of dec. number, showing place value of each digit + breakdown]

        positional value determined by base ^ place value

sixth slide
    positional value (cont.)
        e.g. 139,728 in decimal
        -> 1*10^5 + 3*10^4 + 9*10^3 + 7*10^2 + 2*10^1 + 8*10^0 = 139,728 in decimal
        however: 139,728 in hexadecimal
        -> 1*16^5 + 3*16^4 + 9*16^3 + 7*16^2 + 2*16^1 + 8*16^0 = 1,283,880 in decimal
        (note: show simplified to addition as well)

seventh + eighth slides
    conversions - binary
        decimal:
        work out positional value, two examples
        two more examples, use shorthand method
        hex + octal, do the same, but one example for each method

next 4 slides, same again, but converting octal, and then hex to the
other three

thirteenth slide
    binary addition
        show table
fourteenth slide
    binary addition examples

fifteenth slide
    binary subtraction - rules
sixteenth slide
    examples
