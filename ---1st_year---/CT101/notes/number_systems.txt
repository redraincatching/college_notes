2021/10/12 - numbering systems
overview:
    - know the different base systems
    - describe positional notation
    - convert other bases to base 10
    - describe the relationship between bases 2, 8, and 16
    - fractions
    - negative number representation (sign bit vs. complementary notation)

number categories
    natural, negative, irrational, etc.
comp. definition of numbers
    - unit belonging to an abstract mathematical system subject to specified
    laws of succession, addition, and multiplication

base - the number of digits used in a system
    base n, digits are (0, 1, [â€¦], n-1)
    // also determines what the positions mean
    // subscripts can be used to indicate base

positional notation
    each position has a place value, and the total number is equal to the
    sum of the digits * their place value
    // place value is base^(position from right, starting at 0)

    e.g. 954 in decimal
        -> 9*10^2 + 5*10^1 + 4*10^0 = 954 in decimal
         954 in hex
        -> 9*16^2 + 5*16^1 + 4*16^0 = 2388 in decimal
