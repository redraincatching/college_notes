    buffers
        a digital (or voltage) buffer is an electronic circuit element that is used to boost power without changing the voltage waveform
        used to isolate the input from the output, providing either no voltage, or the same as the input voltage

        regular buffer
            passes the input to the output
            purpose is to boost the signal of the input to a higher level (i.e. maintain 1 or 0 values)

        tri-state buffer
            (curse you perry the platypus)
            has a data input, and also an ENABLE/CONTROLLER input
                - if ENB=1, the buffer is enabled, and the input is passed to the output
                - if ENB=0, the buffer is disabled, and the output will be in the high impedance state z

    multiplexer (mux)
        a combinational circuit that selects binary information from one of the input lines, and directs it to the output line - functions as a selector
        [diagram]
        multiplexers can be cascaded to select from a large number of inputs

    encoder
        a circuit that changes a set of signals into codes
        an encoder receives 2^n inputs, and outputs an n-bit value corresponding to the one input that has a value of 1
        a 4-to-2 encoder is represented below
        [diagram]
        input: 4 data lines
            each input line has a corresponding binary number, and the output of the encoder is that signal (in our example, S_1 S_0 are our output bits)
            a decoder will take that output signal, and read the input signal from there

    priority encoder
        the same, but whenever one or more input is active, the output is set to correspond to the highest active input

    comparators
        compare two input values or voltages
        compares two n-bit binary values to determine which is greater, or if they are equal (reference voltage vs detected voltage)

    adder/half adder
        (not a snake)
        used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
        most basic: half adder
            inputs two 1-bit values, x and y, and outputs their two-bit sum as bits C and S
            C is the carry, S is the sum
            [diagram]

        full adder:
            three inputs - one carry bit, two input bits
            [diagram]
            two outputs - one carry, one sum

        memory circuits
            group of circuits used to store data
            not strictly combinatorial in design, but can be used as a combinatorial component

            RAM
                read/write memory that doesn't initially contain any data
                the computing system that it is used in usually contains [...]
