xml and the semantic web
    the aim of semantic web search technologies is to represent data in a form that can be parsed more easily by a program.

    semantic web - definition
        "a set of standards and best practices for sharing data and the semantics of that data over the web for use by applications."

    "set of standards"
        - RDF data model
        - RDF schema
        - SPARQL query language     // no, seriously
        - OWL standards for storing vocabularies and ontologies
        - use of URIs to name things

    xml - extensible markup language
        universal metalanguage for specifying markup
        set of tags which allow us to define the semantics of something, allowing us to define the meaning of data
        both human and machine readable
            // not to be confused with html, this is data semantics, not data presentation
        we can define our own tags, but it's more useful to use an existing standard

        xml consists of
            opening and closing tags
                <code> ... </code>
            elements
                <code> ct102 </code>
            nodes
                root, sibling, and child nodes
                // document should have one root element
                // tag names are case sensitive

        attributes
            designed to contain data related to a specific element
            must always be quoted
            can be used instead of elements, depending on context
            (syntax similar to html)

        formatting an xml document
            the first line identifies the xml version and encoding used
            e.g.
                <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

    URI / IRI
        uniform / international resource identifier
        uris only use ascii characters, iris use unicode
        // not to be confused with a url, a uniform resource locator

        namespaces
            a set of names used for a certain purpose
                to avoid mixups like title for person vs. title of film
            namespaces provide a method to avoid element and attribute name conflicts
            essentially provide a standardised vocabulary to use, or allow you to specify a unique one

            a namespace is a uri
            an xml namespace is declared as below
                <elementname xmlns:prefix=“namespace”>

    xml query
        query language that allows querying of xml statements
        similar to sql query

    xml schema
        describes the structure of an xml document
        the xml schema language is often referred to as xml schema definition (XSD)
        these schemas
            are written in xml
            are extensible
            support data types and namespaces

    RDF - resource description framework
        rdf identifies "things" using uris, and describes resources with properties and property values
        uses xml (rdf/xml)
        allows data to be specified about resources
        resources can be anything
        each rdf statement comprises a triple of subject, predicate, object
            subjects and objects are resources
            predicates are the directional relations between them

    SPARQL
        language used for querying and updating data based on rdf triples
        sql-like

    open data
        can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose
        open data sources can be textual, maps, genomes, anything
        e.g. openstreetmap.org, wikidata.org, genome.gov, ireland's open data portal

        linked open data
            open data that is linked to other open data (wow)
            published in rdf format

            three linked-data "rules" - sir tim berners-lee
                - all kinds of conceptual things should have a http prefix
                - looking up one of these http names returns data in a standard format
                - these things should have relations, i.e., links to other things with the http prefix

            dbpedia
                wikipedia converted to structured semantic format
                9.5+ billion rdf triples
                constantly updated

            wikidata
                similar, but started from scratch, not extracted from wikipedia
                use unique identifiers
                    Q - item (e.g. Q692 - william shakespeare)
                    P - property (e.g. P19 - place of birth, P569 - date of birth)

    search engines and semantic data
        search engines use semantic data to answer questions, not just return results to queries
            this data is referred to as the "knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"
        this marks a move away from data and information processing, and towards knowledge processing
            this "knowledge" is all scraped from databases like dbpedia, or from tagged websites

recommender systems
    a system that suggests items to a user to support decision-making processes
    these systems tend to use preferences and ratings, as well as social links

    preferences and ratings are indicative of a user's likes or dislikes
        this data can be gathered implicitly or explicitly
            explicitly - rate/like something
            implicitly - watching/listening to something

        implicit ratings
            numeric representations are usually stored, and these may be gathered and weighted over time
            usually in one of these ranges
                - 0, 1 (binary)
                - -1, 0, 1 (like, dislike, nothing)
                - 1-5, 1-10 (star system)
                    // note: larger scales aren't always better, people "prefer" different portions of the scale
            numeric rating and preference data can be interpreted as a matrix
                // most entries would be zero (sparsity, often >99%)

        preferences vs ratings vs reviews
            reviews have content, and may be more nuanced or difficult to process
            ratings =~= preferences
            implicit preferences are generally more "noisy" than explicit ones, and are more plentiful

        profiles
            user profiles - all the preference data stored for a user
                // note: also holds preference history for a user
            item profiles - the preference data for a user

            can be stored in a database or freeform (structured or unstructured)
            using this data
                can be used for personalised or non-personalised recommendations
                can be handled in several ways
                    - databases
                    - statistical (correlation) approach
                    - matrix factorisation
                    - machine learning

                non-personalised recommendations
                    list of items generated for everyone
                        useful for new users, or to offer diversity to users
                    based on several attributes
                        - popularity: how many people watch it
                        - newness: how recently it became available
                        - velocity: rate of popularity growth

                    implementation
                        keep an ordered list of content ids, based on the above weighted attributes
