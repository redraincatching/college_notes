data and information security
    for as long as there have been secrets, there's been data security
    involves defending data from unauthorised:
        - use
        - access
        - disclosure
        - disruption
        - modification
        - inspection
        - recording
        - destruction

    information security threat - hacking
        any action that exploits a weakness in a system, often spreading malware as a result

    examples of security breaches
        - surveillance
        - masquerading
        - tampering
        - replaying
        - infiltrating
        - decoding

    malware
        virus
            software that copies itself onto the host system and replicates
        worm
            specific virus that spreads using flaws in the OS, often degrading performance in some way, e.g. the morris worm
        bots
            an advanced form of a worm designed to interact over the internet with no human action
        trojan horse
            usually an email attachment which looks legitimate, but is actually an .exe file
        ransomware
            program encrypts files when it runs, only decrypting it on receiving payment
        spyware
            secretly logs and reports information on user actions, e.g. pegasus. can be used as a part of trgeted advertising (adware)
        scareware
            masquerades as useful software, but will infect or destroy a system if installed
        rootkits
            designed to gain root or admin access
        ddos (distributed denial of service)
            seeks to overload the bandwidth and resources of a system by bombarding it with simultaneous connections (from multiple distributed locations) to cause servers to crash

    data privacy
        protecting data is a business, legal, and ethical requirement
        private data must be kept secure:
            - at rest (stored) and when being transmitted
            - when being processed
            - when being disposed of, or when the device it is stored on is disposed of

        data stored should be (by law)
            - factually correct
            - only available to those who should have it
            - only used for stated purpose

        gdpr data protection
            - highest-possible privacy settings by default
            - data should not be publicly available without explicit, informed consent
            - cannot be used to identify a subject without other data
            - no personal data should be processed without regulation or explicit consent
            - subject has the right to revoke consent at any time

        CIA triad
            confidentiality, integrity, availability
            information security needs a culture of continual improvement

            confidentiality
                information that is secret should stay secret
                - only people authorised to access the data may do so
                - encryption and access controls to protect confidentiality

            integrity
                relates to trustworthiness, origin, completeness, and correctness of information
                data should not be modified in an unauthorised or undetected manner
                to protect integrity
                    - prevent unauthorised modification of information
                    - detect unauthorised modifications

            availability
                relates to ensuring that authorised users can access and use systems if they want to
                threats to availability
                    - natural/human disasters
                    - malicious attacks (ddos, etc.)
                high availability system - aim to remain available at all times, e.g. gmail

    security approaches
        1) identify, authenticate, authorise sequence
        2) accountability
        3) policies/code of conduct
            specification of the security properties a system should have and how people should treat data
        4) encryption
            transforming data into something that cannot be understood - cryptography

    "the weakest link"
        the strength of a system is no greater than that of its weakest link
        if different security mechanisms are enforced for each component of an information system, there is "defence in depth"
        research and experience has shown that the most vulnerable point in most systems is the human element - social engineering

    approach 1
        identification
            - identifying who or what
            - usually some unique username or code
                must be locally unique, and possibly globally (e.g. email address)
        authentication
            three methods
            - what you know (e.g. password)
            - what you have (e.g. key)
            - what you are (e.g. facial rec)

        problems with passwords
            often too short
            often too simple (hunter2)
            same password used across multiple systems
            an insecure version of the password exists (written or in a breach)
            prone to phishing

        useful: password management

        multi-factor authentication
            mfa/2fa
            multiple different authentication vectors checked

            2fa
                common nowadays
                supplements a password with "what you have" - a smartphone, etc
                uses a TOTP - time-based one-time password
                    sent by text or push notification
                recommended by National Institute of Standards and Technology to secure online accounts of any kind

                note: major issue with digital exclusion here for those without a smartphone or certain disabilities (can't scan a fingerprint if you have no hands)

    approach 2
        accountability
            systems require logs and traces to check if usage is authorised

    approach 3
        access control
            level of access control required specified by policies and code of conduct
            these involve
                - assigning a security classification to data
                - specifying an access control policy
                - specifying a handling rule

            [diagram]

            traffic light protocol (tlp)
                - white: unlimited, distribute freely
                - green: community-wide distribution
                - amber: limited, need-to-know distribution
                - red: very restricted, named people only

            access control models
                DAC - discretionary access control
                    individual users specify the security aspects of an object
                MAC - mandatory access control
                    security is centrally controlled by a security policy administrator
                RBAC - role-based access control
                    defined around roles and privileges in an organisation

    approach 4
        levels of cryptography
            1) algorithms
            2) protocols - built on algorithms
            3) applications - built on protocols

            e.g.
                - ssl: secure socket layer
                - https: secure hypertext transfer protocol

            classes of cryptography systems
                symmetric
                    one key used for encryption and decryption
                    can be divided into stream or block ciphers
                    stream cipher: each bit is encrypted individually
                    block cipher: message units are grouped and encrypted

                asymmetric
                    rsa encryption, public key encryption
                    decryption cannot reasonably be derived from public key
