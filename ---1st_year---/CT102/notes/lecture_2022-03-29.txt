exam topics (information systems):
    - compression
    - search engines
    - page rank
    - recommender systems
    - structured data (not xml)

    // calculator allowed, formulas not given (cosine, pearson, page rank, etc.)
    // stop words/stemming rules should be general, no need to memorise specifics

    compression
        - huffman algorithm
        - arithmetic encoding

    search engines
        - preprocessing
            case folding, punctuation removal, stop word removal, stemming
            // generally need examples of these
        - weighting
            tf*idf
        - cosine similarity

    database systems
        - primary keys
        - functional dependencies
        - redundancy & normalisation
        - sql (SELEFT, FROM, WHERE)

    recommender systems
        - explicit vs. implicit rating
        - content vs. collaborative filtering
        - nearest neighbour approach
        // note: cosine similarity will not be asked here, but pearson correlation might
            -> check which to use, zero/nonzero?
        // note: pearson correlation is just cosine similarity but normalised by subtracting average ratings
            // cosine sim. is already normalised by tf*idf weighting
            // note: pearson correlation is in a range of -1 < x < 1
        - recommendation generation formula
            p_(a, i) = r_bar a + \frac{\sum (r_(u,i) - r_bar u)*w_(a,u)}{\sum w_(a,u)}

    social network analysis
        - representations
            edge list, adjacency matrix, graph
        - directed & undirected
        - measures
            degree, edge density, clustering coefficient, paths
            // only count outward paths for clustering coefficient
