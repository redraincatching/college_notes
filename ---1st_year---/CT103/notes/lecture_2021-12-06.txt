enumeration
    enumeration is a user-defined datatype in the c language, used to assign names to variables
    used with the enum keyword

    for example:
        in an ordering system, the status of an order could be
            - open
            - closed
            - delivered
            - cancelled
        in an alarm system, it could be
            - read
            - asleep
            - maintenance

        underlying those names would need to be values
            e.g.
            - open      = 101
            - closed    = 102
            - delivered = 103
            - cancelled = 104

    syntax
        // declaration
        enum <variable_name> {<names>, <of>, <states>}; // 0-based index, of course
        // instantiation
        enum <variable_name> <object_of_this_enum>
            // e.g.
            enum days_of_week day;
        // operation
        <obj_enum> = <state>;
            // e.g.
            day = wed;

    enumeration using typedef
        syntax
            typedef enum {<states>} <name_of_enum>;

        useful because then you can declare functions of that type, to return one of those states

sorting algorithms
    algorithms that put items in the correct order
        most commonly, based on numeric value

    many different types
        - bubble sort
        - merge sort
        - insertion sort
        - quick sort
        - selection sort
        - bogosort

    bubble sort
        comparing elements to make larger numbers move higher in the array
        (they "float" up to the top)
        not the most efficient, but that's okay
