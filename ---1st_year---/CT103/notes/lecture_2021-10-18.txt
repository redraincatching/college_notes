loops (cont.)

for loops
    useful if we want to repeat something a predetermined amount of times
        possible with a while loops, but for loops are shorter
            while
                1. initialise variable
                2. test + loop
                3. increment
            for
                1. test + loop

    // syntax
    for (int i = 0; i < [max]; i++) {   // we can also initialise beforehand
        // do something
    }

    // useful for loops: when printing a variable, such as the counter here,
    // you could use printf("%d", i+1); to increase human readability
        // (arrays start at 0)
