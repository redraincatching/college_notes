recursion
    method of problem solving by reducing them to smaller problems, that resemble the form of the original problem
        can make code more readable
        a recursive function is one that calls itself

    recursion can lead to an "infinite" loop quite easily
        // well, until a stack overflow crash, at least

    fibonacci sequence
        sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers

        recursive fibonacci function example
            int fibonacci(int n){
                if (n<=1) {
                    return n;   // cause the first 2 terms are 0 and 1
                }
                return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
            }
