functions
    a piece of code that can be called whenever we need to execute it
    why?
        - avoids repetition
        - increases readability
        - enables division of problems
        - easier to maintain

    syntax
        <type> <name> (<arguments>) {
            return;
        }

    function type
        tells the compiler what type of variable the function returns
        can be a standard type (int, float, double, char) or can be void

    // you can't name a function one of the 32 reserved words [see table]

    function prototypes
        before you can use a function, you have to give it a prototype
        this is done before it is called, usually before main(), and after any #include or #define statements
