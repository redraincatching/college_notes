testing characters
    there are a number of tests that we can use to analyse characters
    we first need to include the <ctype.h> library

    useful tests
        isalpha
            checks if the character is alphabetical (i.e. a letter)
        isalnum
            checks if the character is alphanumeric (letter or number)
        isdigit
            checks if the character is a digit
        isupper
            checks if the character is uppercase
        islower
            checks if the character is lowercase
        isspace
            checks if the character is a space
                // handy for splitting strings, like in a first and surname

        syntax
            <test>(<character>);

character mapping
    functions to convert character case

    toupper
        converts a character to uppercase
    tolower
        converts a character to lowercase

arrays of strings
    lists of strings, stored as a 2d array
    each row is a different string
    each column is a character
