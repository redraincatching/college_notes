loops
    useful for repeating tasks

while loop
    - repeats a task while a condition is true

    // syntax
    while (condition) {
        // do thing
    }

    // note, if using a variable as a counter, you can use [variable]++;
    // counter has to be initialised before the loop begins, i think
        -> check this
    // to increase it at the end of a loop
        // this is used to avoid infinite loops

do while loop
    - variant on while loops

    // syntax
    do {
        // do thing
    } while (condition);

    // when you want to cause the action first, then enter the loop
        // ensures that the block of code is executed at least once
