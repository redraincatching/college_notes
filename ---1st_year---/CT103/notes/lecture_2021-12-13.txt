bubble sort
    first element, check if larger than second, if so, swap
    next element, check if larger than following, if so, swap
    continue until reach last element
        repeat, starting at one, and ending at penultimate spot

    structure
        outer for loop for loops
            inner for loop for size comparisons
        array to iterate through

    pseudocode (or python, not much difference)
        1. initialise array, indices
        2. for p = 0 up to array length
        3. for i = 0 up to array length - p-1
        4. if (item at position i > item at position i+1)
        5. swap
