arrays
    if you use a superclass as a reference type, all subclasses can be entered
    e.g. Animal array can store Canary, Shark, Cheetah, etc.

    array.length returns length

    implicit use of toString
        in general, java will look for toString when it is required to print an object

        System.out.println(animals[i]) will look for a toString method for all of these

    enhanced for loops
        you can loop over a full array with the below syntax
            for (Animal a: animals){
                System.out.println(a);
            }

        a regular for loop increases the integer, and accesses the array through the index
        
        an enhanced for loop starts by declaring the type of data stored in the array
        then you create a temporary variable which is used to loop through this array
        then, after a colon, the name of the array
            the temp variable is then equal to the value of each element in the array
