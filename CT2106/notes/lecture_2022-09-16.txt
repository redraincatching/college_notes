example problem
    several car objects
    each car has an engine, with kilometers per gallon and fuel as properties
    each car has a totaldistance

    each car should have a "move_distance" method, which then prints out the fuel remaining, total distance travelled, and estimated distance the car can still travel


class relationships
    is-a vs. has-a
        has-a is composition
        is-a is inheritance     // will elaborate on this in later classes

    composition
        one object is composed of one or more others, and relies upon their services for its own functionality

        [[diagram]]
            -> a diamond denotes composition
            -> the number denotes the amount used in composition

        to realise this relationship, you create a link between participant classes using a reference variable type
        the reference declaration is in the "owner" class
        in our example, the car "owns" the engine


java main method
    entry point to code
    often put in the "test" class

        public static void main(String args[]) {
                // code goes here
        }
