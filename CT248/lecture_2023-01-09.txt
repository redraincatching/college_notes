matlab
    high-level language
    MATrix LABoratory
    designed to make matrix computations particularly easy
    used for 
        - numerical computation
        - data analysis
        - algorithm development and programming
        - application development and deployment

    variables
        loosely typed
        only letters, digits, and underscores
        must start with a letter
        case sensitive
        the semi-colon at the end is actually optional, but it prevents the value from being displayed
        syntax
            <name> = <value>;

    the matlab workspace
        all the variables created during a session remain in the workspace until you clear them
        the command who lists all the names in the workspace
        the commands whos also lists the size of them
        the ide holds a visual representation of this

        // note: the function ans returns the last value evaluated and not assigned to a variable

    statements
        frequently of the form <variable> = <expression>
        statements that are too long for a line can be extended by an ellipsis of at least three dots

    i/o
        name = input ('enter your name: ', 's');
        fprintf("your name is %s\n", name);

        // can also use disp()

    general process - IPO
        input -> process -> output

    repetition
        for loop syntax example

        for i = 1:5
            disp(i)
        end
