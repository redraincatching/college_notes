functions in matlab
    functions are in their own source files
    differs from script files in that they can only communicate with specified inputs and outputs
    functions can also be passed as parameters to other functions - callbacks
    general syntax
        % file: name.m

        function[outarg1, outarg2, ..., outarg_n] = name(inargs)
        % comments here are displayed with "help <fname>"
            %{
                do things
            %}
        end
        
    local variables
        anything defined inside a function is not accessible outside it, and only exists in the function's workspace (separate from the base one)
    global variables
        define it in the base script and the function with global
        e.g.
            global X
    persistent variables
        remain persistent between function calls
        initially an empty array
        e.g.
            function persist
            persistent counter

            if isempty(counter)
                counter = 1;
            else
                counter = counter + 1;
            end

    vector arguments
        in and out args can be vectors

    closures
        can return contained functions to outer calls
        same as in js

    a function can be called with all, some, or none of its arguments, same as output
    nargin displays the args passed

    subfunctions
        the m-file may contain multiple functions, but the first (the one that has the name of the file) is the primary function, and all others are the subfunctions
