weak entity
    has total participation in a relationship with another entity
    definitionally, they don't have a defining key of their own, so they rely on other entity for that identification

// note: sometimes in er models, multi-variable attributes can be modelled as tables

with a 1:1 relationship, doesn't really matter which side the foreign key is

mapping an er diagram to tables
    steps 
        1) for each entity, create a table R that contains all the simple attributes of that entity
        2) for strong entities, choose a primary key
        3) for weak entities, choose a foreign key from the strong entity and create a primery key based on that
        4) for each 1:1 binary relationship, choose foreign keys, if applicable the entity with total participation
        5) for each 1:N binary relationship, choose foreign keys in the one-side table that identify at most one in the other
        6) for each M:N, create a new table S to represent the relationship
            include as foreign kes in S the primary keys of the participating tables, and both keys together are the primary key
        7) for each mva, create a new table to represent that
            this includes an attribute corresponding to the original table and that original table's primary key, and a ocmbinationof both will be the primary key
