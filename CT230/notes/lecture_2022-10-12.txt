joins and union queries
    joins
        used when you require data from two different tables
        combine multiple tables into one table
        this new table is then queried to produce a result

        tables are joined by specifying links across tables
        tables are joined two at a time, but multiple can be added

        specifying joins
            1) in sql we must specify all tables which are part of the join in the SELECT clause
                // there are many types of joins, not all of which are supported, but we will use the inner join, which always is
            2) must then specify the join condition
                for an inner join the condition is foreign_key = primary_key/candidate_key
            3) the join condition can be specified in the FROM or WHERE clause

        inner join
            [[diagram]]
            for our example company db
            join condition
                ssn = essn
            syntax
                SELECT *
                FROM employee INNER JOIN dependent
                    ON ssn = essn;

            example
                list the details (name, birth date and address) of the children of franklin t wong

                    SELECT dependent_name, dependent.bdate, address
                    FROM employee INNER JOIN dependent ON
                        ssn = essn
                    WHERE relationship != 'spouse'
                        AND fname = 'Franklin'
                        AND minit = 'T'
                        AND lname = 'Wong'; 

                    // note the dependent.bdate, as bdate is an attribute in both tables
                    // can always be done, not usually useful
