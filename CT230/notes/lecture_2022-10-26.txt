normalisations - first normal form (1NF)
    a table is in 1NF if it has no repeating groups
        a group of attributes that occur a variable number of times in each record
        to ensure, choose appropriate primary key and split table if necessary
    
2NF
    a table is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and satisfies the following
        where there is a composite primary key, all non-key attributes must be fully functionally dependent on the whole primary key 

        example

3NF
    in 3NF if in 2NF and there are no dependencies between attributes that are not primary keys

boyce-codd normal form (BCNF)
    a table in 3NF where there are no overlapping candidate keys
