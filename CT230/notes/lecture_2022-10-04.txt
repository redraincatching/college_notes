designing tables with er models
    
    data models
        concepts to describe the structure of a database
        they comprise
            - high-level or logical models
            - representational/implementation data models
            - physical data models

        they allow for database abstraction

    entity relationship models
        - provide a way to model the data that will be stored in the system
        
        top-down approach to database design
            used to identify:
                1) important data, entities
                2) relationship between entities
                3) attributes of entities
                4) the constraints of relationships and entities

        notations
            chen notation
                - entity
                    a rectangle
                - weak entity
                    an entity dependent on another to be identified
                    rectangle with offset
                - attribute
                    an oval
                    can be subdivided into more ovals, e.g. "name" -> fname, minit, lname
                - entity-attribute links
                    straight line
                - strong relationship
                    diamond
                - weak relationship
                    offset diamond

                cardinality
                    one-to-one - 1:1
                    many-to-one - 1:N, N:1
                    many-to-many - M:N

            other notations
                - crow's foot
                - uml
