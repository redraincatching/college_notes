aggregate functions
    // only supported in SELECT and HAVING clauses
    SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX can only be applied to numeric data
        -> mathematical operations can also be used in the query
    COUNT returns the number of tuples in a query
    
    sample query using COUNT
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'no. employee on prod. y'
        FROM works_on
        WHERE pno = 
            (SELECT pnumber
            FROM project
            WHERE pname = 'productY'
            );

        // note: single value, use =, single or more use IN

GROUP BY ... HAVING
    recall 
        SELECT ... 
        FROM ... 
        WHERE ... 
        GROUP BY ...    <--
        HAVING ...      <--
        ORDER BY ...

    GROUP BY
        allows the combining of rows of a table together so that all occurrences within a specified group are together
        aggregate functions can be applied to these groups

        // the aggregate functions are applied in the SELECT clause, not in group
        // GROUP BY must mention all the arguments in the SELECT clause unless they are involved in an aggregate

        example
            SELECT dno, COUNT(*) AS num_emps
            FROM employee
            GROUP BY dno;
                // output
                    dno     | num_emps
                    1       | 1
                    4       | 3
                    5       | 4

            HAVING is just a condintinal addition to that
