javadoc and lambda expressions
    javadoc is a means of documenting java code that can be used to generate full documentation
    a javadoc comment is similar to a regular comment, but starts with /** rather than /*
    
    for examples look at existing java classes

    two main uses - before class definition and before methods

    uses annotations
        - @author
        - @version
        - @return
            what is returned from a given method
        - @param
            parameters of a methods

lambda expressions
    parameter -> expression
    (param1, param2) -> expression

    anonymous inner classes that are based on a single method interface, like actionlistener, can be implemented as lambda functions

        e.g.
            public interface Whatever {
                public int returnShit(int param);
            }

            // another class
            Whatever w = thing -> {
                // do stuff
            };
