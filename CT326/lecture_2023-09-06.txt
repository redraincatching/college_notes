testing
    systematic process of analysing a system or component to detect the differences between the specified and observed behaviour
    the aim is to find all inconsistencies

    - unit testing
        testing individual classes and mechanisms
    - integration testing
        testing groups of classes or components and the interfaces between them
    - system testing
        testing the system as a whole

    test-driven development
        a software process that relies on the repetition of a short dev cycle
        rationale is "write the test, then pass it"
        tries to find faults with participating objects with respect to the use cases and use case model

        go to class you wish to test
        name of class -> alt + enter
        create test

    test cases
        a test component is part of a system that can be isolated for testing
        unit testing finds differences between a specificationof an object and its realisation as a component
        a test case is a set of inputs and expected results that exercise a test component with the purpose of causing failures and detecting faults
        blackbox testing focuses on the externals (i.e. that the result is expected) and ignore internal workings
        whitebox testing focus on the internal structure and dynamics

    after writing a failing test, then write the _minimum amount of passing code_
        this is important, so if we want something to return 1 to pass, instead of implementing functionality, we first just make it return one
        then we make tests more sophisticated so that they can't be passed without correct functionality

    test case annotations
        @Test
            - this function is a test
        @BeforeEach
            - used if you want to execute some preconditions before each test case
            - used for init methods
        @AfterEach
            - teardown methods like memory cleanup or logout
        @BeforeAll
            - execute once before all tests
            - used for expensive operations like database startup
            - must be static

        can also use LOG.info("message") to notate this
        e.g.
            startup ...
            executing test ...
            teardown ...
