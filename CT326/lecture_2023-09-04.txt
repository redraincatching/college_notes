command line programming and common problems
    compiling with javac
        javac -d bin src/Account.java
            -d changes the output folder to /bin
        java -classpath bin Account
            runs the compiled class


        javac -d bin -classpath bin src/AccountApp.java
            adds bin to the classpath so that AccountApp can use the compiled Account class
