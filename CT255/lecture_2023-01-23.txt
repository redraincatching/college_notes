handling keyboard events
    in gui-based languages such as java (with awt) the mouse and keyboard are handled as events
    queued as they happen and awt dispatches then to waiting listeners upon cpu freeing up

    handling keyboard input
        - class that implements keylistener
        - instance of that class
        - add this instance as a key listener attached to the jframe that receives messages from the os
            // simplest way is to make the class that extends jframe handle the events itself
