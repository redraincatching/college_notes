cookies
    session cookies
        - a.k.a. in-memory or transient cookies
        - browsers normally delete these on closing
        - these are defined due to having no expiration date
    persistent cookies
        - expire at a specific time/date, or after a set period of time
        - for the lifespan of the cookie, its information will be transmitted every time the user accesses the website
        - these are sometimes referred to as "tracking" cookies

    gdpr and cookies
        generally, a user's permission must be sought before a cookie is installed on the browser
        two exceptions
            - communication exception
            - strictly necessary exception

            communication exception
                this applies to cookies whose sole purpose is for carrying out the transmission of a communication over a network, for example to identify the communication endpoints

                e.g. load balancing cookies that distribute traffic between backend servers (session stickiness)
                
                session stickiness
                    a load balancer creates an affinity between a given user and a specific server for the duration of that user's session
                    subsequently, all traffic from this user is routed to this server

            strictly necessary exception
                must be linked to a web-provided service
                the service must have been explicitly requested by the user
                advertising cookie are not strictly necessary

                e.g. language preference, shopping cart

entities in gdpr
    - data subject
    - data protection officer (dpo)
    - data controller
    - data processor

    data subject
        the person to whom the data belongs
        note: after death, gdpr does not apply, national regulations do
        in ireland, freedom of information act applies

    dpo
        primary role is to ensure that their organisation follows gdpr
        mandatory role for any organisation dealing with data

    data controller
        the organisation with overall control over the processing of the data
        responsible in case of a violation

    data processor
        the body/individual who actually processes the data
        operates under the direction and supervision of the data controller, or are the same body

    cloud service provider
        a data processor unless they are actively offering data processing services

gpdr - some key qualities
    - purpose limitation
        data should be collected to fulfill a clear and explicit purpose, and not used for any other reason
    - data minimisation
        data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary
    - accuracy
        all possible steps must be taken to ensure that data is not incorrect or misleading
    - accountability
    - integrity
    - liability


cybersecurity - cryptography
    hackers
        - black hat
            malicious or destructive actors
        - white hats
            professional defense actors, employed for security purposes
        - grey hats
            bitta both ig
        - suicide hackers
            hackers who act with no regard to consequences, often terrorists/activists wishing to make a statement for a cause

    cryptography
        the art of encompassing the principles and methods of transforming an intelligible message into one that is unintelligible, and then transforming it into its original form

        plaintext
            - the original message
        ciphertext
            - the transformed message
        cipher
            - algorithm used to encipher the message
        key
            - some critical information used by the cipher, known only to the sender and the reciever, to encipher the message, selected from the keyspace k
        encryption
            the mathematical function e_k() mapping plaintext p to ciphertext c
                c = e_k(p)
        decryption
            the function e_k^-1() mapping ciphertext to plaintext as follows
                p = e_k^-1(c)
        cryptanalysis
            the study of principles and methods used in transforming c to p without knowledge of the key
        cryptology
            the field encompassing cryptography and cryptanalysis


        "known plaintext" attack
            attack using a "crib", or a piece of information, to decipher the message
