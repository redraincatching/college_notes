cryptography
    generalised caesar cipher
        - use any shift from 1 to 25, and replace any letter with a letter that fixed displacement away
        - therefore you have 26 ciphers you can try on any encoded text
            - only one key will be useful, however there are only 25 other ciphers, so this is trivial to bruteforce

    simple substitution cipher
        - using a context alphabet, perform the same substitution as a caesar cipher
            -> the "one letter at a time" method is what makes it simple
        
        context alphabet
            placing the letters of a keyword at the start of the alphabet rather than shifting
            e.g.
                zebrascdfghijklmnopqtuvwxy
        
        cryptanalysis via letter frequency
            - human languages are redundant
            - some letters or groups of letters are used more often than others

            [[diagram]]
            tables like this are available for one-, two-, and three-letter groups in various languages

            sample c program for frequency analysis
                #include <stdio.h>
                #include <string.h>
                #include <ctype.h>

                int main(int argc, char *argv[])
                {
                    FILE *fp;
                    int data[26];
                    char c;
                    int i;
                    memset(data, 0, sizeof(data));  
                    // memset copies the character 'c' to the first n characters of the given pointer

                    if (argc != 2) {
                        return(-1);
                    }
                    if ((fp = fopen(argv[1], "r")) == NULL) {
                        return(-2);
                    }

                    while (!feof(fp))
                    {
                        c = toupper(fgetc(fp));
                        if ((c >= 'A') && (c <= 'Z')) {
                            data[c - 65]++;
                            // ascii encoding of A is 65
                        }
                    }
                    for (i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                        printf("%c: %i\n", i + 65, data[i]);
                    }
                   
                    fclose(fp);
                    return(1);
                }

    known plaintext attacks (kpa)
        an attack model where the attacker has both
            - a sample of the plaintext, known as a crib
            - the ciphertext including the encoded crib

    not even the large number of keys in a monoalphabetic cipher provide security
        monoalphabetic - cipher with single letter mapping
        one approach is multiple-letter encryption

    playfair cipher (1854)
        - create a 5x5 matrix using a key at the start
            [[diagram]]
            -> i = j
        - letters encrypted in pairs
            -> repeats have a x inserted as an extra letter between them
        - letters in the same row are both shifted once to thr right
        - letters in the same column are shifted down
        - otherwise, letters are replaced by the letter in its row using 

        example:
            key: prunejuice
            plaintext: kensentmex

            p r u n e
            j c a b d
            f g h k l
            m o q s t
            v w x y z

            ln by pe mo uz
            
            ciphertext: lnbypemouz

        security was much stronger than that of a monoalphabetic cipher, as there were 26^2, or 676 combinations
        however, this could still be broken using 2-letter frequency analysis

    vigenère cipher (1553)
        - blaise de vigenère was known as the creator of polyalphabetic ciphers, or ciphers using multiple susbstitution alphabets
        - more alphabets = more security
        - uses a key to select which alphabet to use
        - i^th letter of key = i^th alphabet

        - write the plaintext out
        - write the key out repeated below it
        - encrypt the corresponding plaintext letter
        
            plaintext:  hereismyplaintextlmao
            key:        ciphercipherciphercip

            h encrypted using alphabet c, e encrypted using alphabet i, etc.

        cracking the vigenère
            - search for repeated strings, the longer the better
            - for each repeated string, count how many letters between the first letters in both repetition, plus one
            - factor the number
            - repeat this process
            - the most common factor is probably the length of the keyword
