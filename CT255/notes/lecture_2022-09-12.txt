    motivation
        cyberattacks are aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information, extorting money, or interrupting normal business processes

    primary aim is to enhance people's control over their own data, and to simplify international business regulation
    contains provisions and requirements related to the processing of personal data of individuals _located in the eea_

        browsers are required to
            - store cookies as large as 4096 bytes
            - support at least 50 cookies per domain
