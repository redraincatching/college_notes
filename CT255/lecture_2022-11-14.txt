block ciphers
    in a block cipher, the message is broken into blocks m1, m2, ... of size k
    each of these is then encrypted
    [[diagram]]
    claude shannon proposed two primitive cryptographic operations for this kind of cipher
        - permutation
        - substitution
    
        permutation
            [[diagram]]
            - binary word (block) has its bits reordered
            - reordering forms the key
            - key describes the combination used
            - operation is represented by a p-box

            // the weight of the binary word remains the same
        
        substitution
            [[diagram]]
            - binary word replaced by another
            - the whole substitution forms the key
            - the key describes the combination used
            - operation is represented by an s-box

        s-p network
            [[diagram]]
            - the key describes the internal wiring of all s-boxes and p-boxes
            - the same key can be used for encoding and decoding, hence it is a private key encryption algorithm
            - the direction of the process determines encoding/decoding

    confusion and diffusion
        a cipher needs, for obvious reasons, to completely obscure statistical properties of the original message
        shannon introduced two terms for this
            - diffusion
                seeks to make the statistical relationship between plaintext and ciphertext as complex as possible
            - confusion
                seeks to make the relationship between the statistics of the ciphertext and the value of the encryption key as complex as possible
            
        in practice - the avalanche effect
            a swap of a single bit either in the key or in the plaintext result in a significant change in the ciphertext
            [[diagram]]
            // example using DES

    block cipher principle - reversible transformation
        transformations must be reversible or non-singular
            [[diagram]]
        must be a 1:1 relationship between ciphertext and plaintext
    
    features of private-key cryptography
        - one key, for sender and receiver
        - algorithm is public, but if key is disclosed, communications are compromised
        - key is symmetric
        - examples include DES (data encryption standard) and AES (advanced encryption standard)

        AES
            successor of DES
            modern block cipher with 128-bit block length
            defacto standard for encryption
        
    block and key length
        large key and block length prevent brute-force attacks
        -> it's always an option to simply try every key
        -> not always feasible

    feistel cipher
        in practice, we need to be able to encrypt and decrypt messages, hence two approache
            - have an inverse of each of the s and p boxes, which doubles the code and hardware needed
            - define a reversible encryption structure, so that the same structure can be used for both operations

    // just do the whole powerpoint ffs
