stream ciphers
    process a message bitwise
    requires a stream key K that is a pseudorandom series of 0s and 1s
    bit-stream K is xor'd with the plaintext M bit by bit to generate the ciphertext C
        C = M_i XOR K_i
    randomness of key destroys statistical properties
    the receiver generates an identical bitstream K and decodes the message M
        M = C_i XOR K_i
    
    vernam cipher
        requires as many random bits as message is long
        every message requires a new key
        such keys must be distributed securely (inefficient)
        for practical reasons, stream ciphers are based on PRGs, pseudo-random generators
            - often based on linear feedback shift registers
            - therefore only the seed for this register must need to be shared
        
        linear feedback shift registers (lfsr)
            [[diagram]]
            - consists of a consists of a binary shift register along with a linear feedback function that operates on some of the bits
            - each time a bit is needed, all bits shift right one position
            - the bit bumped out is the output bit
            - the linear feedback function forms a new bit
            - correctly designed lfsrs can

message authentication
    types of security attack
        - interception
            of info-traffic flow, attacks confidentiality
        - interruption
            of service, attacks availability
        - modification
            of information, attacks integrity
        - fabrication
            of information, attacks authentication

    passive attacks
        eavesdropping or monitoring transmissions
            release of message content
            traffic analysis
                -> pattern of messages rather than content
            // wireshark
    
    active attacks
        involve modification or creation of data streams
            masquerade
                pretend to be a different entity
            replay
                retransmission of intercepted data
            modification
            ddos

    four types of attack in the context of communication across a network, that are addressed by message authentication
        - masquerade
        - content modification
        - sequence modification
        - timing modification -> delete or repeat messages

        hash functions 
            hash function is a variation of a MAC, which produces a fixed-size hash code ("fingerprint") based on the input size
            public and not keyed, therfore the hash value must be encrypted
            traditional CRCs are too weak, and cannot be used
            128-512 bit hash values required
