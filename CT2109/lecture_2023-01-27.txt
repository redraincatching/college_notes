linked lists
    linear linked list
        an adt which stores an arbitrary-length list of data objects as a series of nodes
        each node consistes of data and a link to another node
        each node, except the last, links to a successor node

        self-referential structure type
            every node has a pointer to a node of the same size
        no issue of overflow
        useful for dynamically growing or shrinking lists
        easy to add/remove items from the middle of the list
        sequential access
            inefficient for retrieving arbitrary nodes
