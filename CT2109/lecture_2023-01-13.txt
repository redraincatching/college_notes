abstract data type (adt)
    an abstract model of a data structure that specifies
        - data stored
        - operations that may be performed
    specifies what each operation does, but not how
        basically a black box tht hides the inner structure and operation of the data type
        corresponds naturally to an interface definition
        realised as a concrete data structure with an implementation of a class

    composite adt
        used to manage collections of data (hash tables, arrays, lists, ...)

    stacks and queues - linearly ordered adts for list-structured data
        stack
            filo architecture
            push and pop to add and remove
            example applications
                - processing nested structures
                - undo operation in editor

        queue
            fifo architecture
            enqueue and dequeue to add and remove
            example applications
                - process scheduler in an os
                - ichec jobs
